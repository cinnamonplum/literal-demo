Here we will discuss a few books and this is the general rules/guidelines:

Every month a ‚Äúmad-hatter‚Äù will nominate a book of their choosing. The rest of the members will then vote to approve of the nomination. If the chosen book gets vetoed, the next member displays their nomination. A ‚Äúmad-hatter‚Äù is chosen alphabetically per month.

Remember, this is for fun ! If you hate the book and feel the need to ‚Äúdrop‚Äù it, that‚Äôs totally fair but not fully advised!

More to come :)

Over the last 5 years I can count on one hand how many books I've read (not including textbooks). I use to read so much when I was young my parents would say I was born with a book in my hand, what happened to that girl? The answer is life. I lost my desire for reading in high school and college, life became a lot more serious and I shifted my priorities accordingly. Somewhere along the line my passion reading tapered off and I forgot how much I truly loved it. That is why I am creating this club, you have all expressed your interest in joining a book club but say you have no time or cant commit to reading. Well, consider us your new accountability partners. I want everyone to rekindle their love and passion for literature and share that with all of us. Welcome to Busy Bee's Book Club!
