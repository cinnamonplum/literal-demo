Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees. That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor--and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford's reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive's career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding...six-pack abs.

Maas and Laura Thalassa. A Maiden… Chosen from birth to usher in a new era, Poppy’s life has never been her own. The life of the Maiden is solitary. Never to be touched. Never to be looked upon. Never to be spoken to. Never to experience pleasure. Waiting for the day of her Ascension, she would rather be with the guards, fighting back the evil that took her family, than preparing to be found worthy by the gods. But the choice has never been hers. A Duty… The entire kingdom’s future rests on Poppy’s shoulders, something she’s not even quite sure she wants for herself. Because a Maiden has a heart. And a soul. And longing. And when Hawke, a golden-eyed guard honor bound to ensure her Ascension, enters her life, destiny and duty become tangled with desire and need. He incites her anger, makes her question everything she believes in, and tempts her with the forbidden. A Kingdom… Forsaken by the gods and feared by mortals, a fallen kingdom is rising once more, determined to take back what they believe is theirs through violence and vengeance. And as the shadow of those cursed draws closer, the line between what is forbidden and what is right becomes blurred. Poppy is not only on the verge of losing her heart and being found unworthy by the gods, but also her life when every blood-soaked thread that holds her world together begins to unravel.

The year is 1926, and Shanghai hums to the tune of debauchery. A blood feud between two gangs runs the streets red, leaving the city helpless in the grip of chaos.

Maas and Laura Thalassa. A Maiden… Chosen from birth to usher in a new era, Poppy’s life has never been her own. The life of the Maiden is solitary. Never to be touched. Never to be looked upon. Never to be spoken to. Never to experience pleasure. Waiting for the day of her Ascension, she would rather be with the guards, fighting back the evil that took her family, than preparing to be found worthy by the gods. But the choice has never been hers. A Duty… The entire kingdom’s future rests on Poppy’s shoulders, something she’s not even quite sure she wants for herself. Because a Maiden has a heart. And a soul. And longing. And when Hawke, a golden-eyed guard honor bound to ensure her Ascension, enters her life, destiny and duty become tangled with desire and need. He incites her anger, makes her question everything she believes in, and tempts her with the forbidden. A Kingdom… Forsaken by the gods and feared by mortals, a fallen kingdom is rising once more, determined to take back what they believe is theirs through violence and vengeance. And as the shadow of those cursed draws closer, the line between what is forbidden and what is right becomes blurred.

She’s come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector.

   Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.

   But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.",0316556343,9780316556347,en,393,2018-04-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Little, Brown",,https://assets.literal.club/4/ckppt3chb609341givgend0zvh.jpg,"[{'id': 'ckqupg44u09uh01euxu5f985y', 'name': 'Madeline Miller', 'slug': 'madeline-miller-n47ql', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#FF99BE', '#DCC7F5', '#FAAFE0']",ckqupg3va09ua01eunyeulghy,Book

In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue—Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself. During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen.

The year is 1926, and Shanghai hums to the tune of debauchery. A blood feud between two gangs runs the streets red, leaving the city helpless in the grip of chaos. At the heart of it all is eighteen-year-old Juliette Cai, a former flapper who has returned to assume her role as the proud heir of the Scarlet Gang—a network of criminals far above the law. Their only rivals in power are the White Flowers, who have fought the Scarlets for generations. And behind every move is their heir, Roma Montagov, Juliette’s first love…and first betrayal. But when gangsters on both sides show signs of instability culminating in clawing their own throats out, the people start to whisper. Of a contagion, a madness. Of a monster in the shadows. As the deaths stack up, Juliette and Roma must set their guns—and grudges—aside and work together, for if they can’t stop this mayhem, then there will be no city left for either to rule.",1534457690,9781534457690,en,464,2020-11-17T00:00:00.000Z,Margaret K.

Salinger's New Yorker stories--particularly A Perfect Day for Bananafish, Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut, The Laughing Man, and For Esme With Love and Squalor--will not be surprised by the fact that his first novel is full of children. The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield.

Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it.
There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart.

Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. An honest, evocative, and tender novel, It Ends with Us is “a glorious and touching read, a forever keeper.

Two best friends. Ten summer trips. One last chance to fall in love.

Poppy and Alex. Alex and Poppy. They have nothing in common. She’s a wild child; he wears khakis. She has insatiable wanderlust; he prefers to stay home with a book. And somehow, ever since a fateful car share home from college many years ago, they are the very best of friends.

In fact, the only thing they have in common is that for the next three months, they're living in neighboring beach houses, broke, and bogged down with writer's block. Until, one hazy evening, one thing leads to another and they strike a deal designed to force them out of their creative ruts: Augustus will spend the summer writing something happy, and January will pen the next Great American Novel. She'll take him on field trips worthy of any rom-com montage, and he'll take her to interview surviving members of a backwoods death cult (obviously).

Maas launches her brand-new CRESCENT CITY series with House of Earth and Blood: the story of half-Fae and half-human Bryce Quinlan as she seeks revenge in a contemporary fantasy world of magic, danger, and searing romance. Half-Fae, half-human Bryce Quinlan loves her life. By day, she works for an antiquities dealer, selling barely legal magical artifacts, and by night, she parties with her friends, savoring every pleasure Lunathion-otherwise known as Crescent City-has to offer. But it all comes crumbling down when a ruthless murder shakes the very foundations of the city-and Bryce's world. Two years later, her job has become a dead end, and she now seeks only blissful oblivion in the city's most notorious nightclubs. But when the murderer attacks again, Bryce finds herself dragged into the investigation and paired with an infamous Fallen angel whose own brutal past haunts his every step. Hunt Athalar, personal assassin for the Archangels, wants nothing to do with Bryce Quinlan, despite being ordered to protect her. She stands for everything he once rebelled against and seems more interested in partying than solving the murder, no matter how close to home it might hit. But Hunt soon realizes there's far more to Bryce than meets the eye-and that he's going to have to find a way to work with her if they want to solve this case. As Bryce and Hunt race to untangle the mystery, they have no way of knowing the threads they tug ripple through the underbelly of the city, across warring continents, and down to the darkest levels of Hel, where things that have been sleeping for millennia are beginning to stir...

Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. An honest, evocative, and tender novel, It Ends with Us is “a glorious and touching read, a forever keeper.

Maas and Laura Thalassa. A Maiden… Chosen from birth to usher in a new era, Poppy’s life has never been her own. The life of the Maiden is solitary. Never to be touched. Never to be looked upon. Never to be spoken to. Never to experience pleasure. Waiting for the day of her Ascension, she would rather be with the guards, fighting back the evil that took her family, than preparing to be found worthy by the gods. But the choice has never been hers. A Duty… The entire kingdom’s future rests on Poppy’s shoulders, something she’s not even quite sure she wants for herself. Because a Maiden has a heart. And a soul. And longing. And when Hawke, a golden-eyed guard honor bound to ensure her Ascension, enters her life, destiny and duty become tangled with desire and need. He incites her anger, makes her question everything she believes in, and tempts her with the forbidden. A Kingdom… Forsaken by the gods and feared by mortals, a fallen kingdom is rising once more, determined to take back what they believe is theirs through violence and vengeance. And as the shadow of those cursed draws closer, the line between what is forbidden and what is right becomes blurred. Poppy is not only on the verge of losing her heart and being found unworthy by the gods, but also her life when every blood-soaked thread that holds her world together begins to unravel.

On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself. During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death.

Maas launches her brand-new CRESCENT CITY series with House of Earth and Blood: the story of half-Fae and half-human Bryce Quinlan as she seeks revenge in a contemporary fantasy world of magic, danger, and searing romance. Half-Fae, half-human Bryce Quinlan loves her life. By day, she works for an antiquities dealer, selling barely legal magical artifacts, and by night, she parties with her friends, savoring every pleasure Lunathion-otherwise known as Crescent City-has to offer. But it all comes crumbling down when a ruthless murder shakes the very foundations of the city-and Bryce's world. Two years later, her job has become a dead end, and she now seeks only blissful oblivion in the city's most notorious nightclubs. But when the murderer attacks again, Bryce finds herself dragged into the investigation and paired with an infamous Fallen angel whose own brutal past haunts his every step. Hunt Athalar, personal assassin for the Archangels, wants nothing to do with Bryce Quinlan, despite being ordered to protect her. She stands for everything he once rebelled against and seems more interested in partying than solving the murder, no matter how close to home it might hit. But Hunt soon realizes there's far more to Bryce than meets the eye-and that he's going to have to find a way to work with her if they want to solve this case. As Bryce and Hunt race to untangle the mystery, they have no way of knowing the threads they tug ripple through the underbelly of the city, across warring continents, and down to the darkest levels of Hel, where things that have been sleeping for millennia are beginning to stir...

Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. An honest, evocative, and tender novel, It Ends with Us is “a glorious and touching read, a forever keeper.

Maas launches her brand-new CRESCENT CITY series with House of Earth and Blood: the story of half-Fae and half-human Bryce Quinlan as she seeks revenge in a contemporary fantasy world of magic, danger, and searing romance. Half-Fae, half-human Bryce Quinlan loves her life. By day, she works for an antiquities dealer, selling barely legal magical artifacts, and by night, she parties with her friends, savoring every pleasure Lunathion-otherwise known as Crescent City-has to offer. But it all comes crumbling down when a ruthless murder shakes the very foundations of the city-and Bryce's world. Two years later, her job has become a dead end, and she now seeks only blissful oblivion in the city's most notorious nightclubs. But when the murderer attacks again, Bryce finds herself dragged into the investigation and paired with an infamous Fallen angel whose own brutal past haunts his every step. Hunt Athalar, personal assassin for the Archangels, wants nothing to do with Bryce Quinlan, despite being ordered to protect her. She stands for everything he once rebelled against and seems more interested in partying than solving the murder, no matter how close to home it might hit. But Hunt soon realizes there's far more to Bryce than meets the eye-and that he's going to have to find a way to work with her if they want to solve this case. As Bryce and Hunt race to untangle the mystery, they have no way of knowing the threads they tug ripple through the underbelly of the city, across warring continents, and down to the darkest levels of Hel, where things that have been sleeping for millennia are beginning to stir...

She’s come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.

Salinger's New Yorker stories--particularly A Perfect Day for Bananafish, Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut, The Laughing Man, and For Esme With Love and Squalor--will not be surprised by the fact that his first novel is full of children. The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield.

Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it.
There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart.

Maas and Laura Thalassa. A Maiden… Chosen from birth to usher in a new era, Poppy’s life has never been her own. The life of the Maiden is solitary. Never to be touched. Never to be looked upon. Never to be spoken to. Never to experience pleasure. Waiting for the day of her Ascension, she would rather be with the guards, fighting back the evil that took her family, than preparing to be found worthy by the gods. But the choice has never been hers. A Duty… The entire kingdom’s future rests on Poppy’s shoulders, something she’s not even quite sure she wants for herself. Because a Maiden has a heart. And a soul. And longing. And when Hawke, a golden-eyed guard honor bound to ensure her Ascension, enters her life, destiny and duty become tangled with desire and need. He incites her anger, makes her question everything she believes in, and tempts her with the forbidden. A Kingdom… Forsaken by the gods and feared by mortals, a fallen kingdom is rising once more, determined to take back what they believe is theirs through violence and vengeance. And as the shadow of those cursed draws closer, the line between what is forbidden and what is right becomes blurred. Poppy is not only on the verge of losing her heart and being found unworthy by the gods, but also her life when every blood-soaked thread that holds her world together begins to unravel.

In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue—Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself. During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.

Half-Fae, half-human Bryce Quinlan loves her life. By day, she works for an antiquities dealer, selling barely legal magical artifacts, and by night, she parties with her friends, savoring every pleasure Lunathion-otherwise known as Crescent City-has to offer. But it all comes crumbling down when a ruthless murder shakes the very foundations of the city-and Bryce's world. Two years later, her job has become a dead end, and she now seeks only blissful oblivion in the city's most notorious nightclubs.

A Bustle ""30 Best Fiction Books of 2018"" pick! A brilliantly imaginative talent makes her exciting debut with this epic historical military fantasy, inspired by the bloody history of China’s twentieth century and filled with treachery and magic, in the tradition of Ken Liu’s Grace of Kings and N.K. Jemisin’s Inheritance Trilogy. When Rin aced the Keju—the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies—it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn’t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin’s guardians, who believed they’d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. That she got into Sinegard—the most elite military school in Nikan—was even more surprising. But surprises aren’t always good. Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power—an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive—and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school. For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away . . . Rin’s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late.",0062662597,9780062662590,un,544,2018-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,HarperCollins,,https://assets.literal.club/4/ckpoaubij729191gmzx2p5endf.jpg,"[{'id': 'ckpoaubij729201gmz268gh9w2', 'name': 'R.

More than a match for the ruthless pirate crew, Alosa has only one thing standing between her and the map: her captor, the unexpectedly clever and unfairly attractive first mate Riden. But not to worry, for Alosa has a few tricks up her sleeve, and no lone pirate can stop the Daughter of the Pirate King.

Maas and Laura Thalassa. A Maiden… Chosen from birth to usher in a new era, Poppy’s life has never been her own. The life of the Maiden is solitary. Never to be touched. Never to be looked upon. Never to be spoken to. Never to experience pleasure. Waiting for the day of her Ascension, she would rather be with the guards, fighting back the evil that took her family, than preparing to be found worthy by the gods. But the choice has never been hers. A Duty… The entire kingdom’s future rests on Poppy’s shoulders, something she’s not even quite sure she wants for herself. Because a Maiden has a heart. And a soul. And longing. And when Hawke, a golden-eyed guard honor bound to ensure her Ascension, enters her life, destiny and duty become tangled with desire and need. He incites her anger, makes her question everything she believes in, and tempts her with the forbidden. A Kingdom… Forsaken by the gods and feared by mortals, a fallen kingdom is rising once more, determined to take back what they believe is theirs through violence and vengeance. And as the shadow of those cursed draws closer, the line between what is forbidden and what is right becomes blurred. Poppy is not only on the verge of losing her heart and being found unworthy by the gods, but also her life when every blood-soaked thread that holds her world together begins to unravel.

For two sworn enemies, anything can happen during the Hawaiian trip of a lifetime—maybe even love—in this romantic comedy from the New York Times bestselling authors of Roomies.

Olive Torres is used to being the unlucky twin: from inexplicable mishaps to a recent layoff, her life seems to be almost comically jinxed. By contrast, her sister Ami is an eternal champion...she even managed to finance her entire wedding by winning a slew of contests. Unfortunately for Olive, the only thing worse than constant bad luck is having to spend the wedding day with the best man (and her nemesis), Ethan Thomas.

Olive braces herself for wedding hell, determined to put on a brave face, but when the entire wedding party gets food poisoning, the only people who aren’t affected are Olive and Ethan. Suddenly there’s a free honeymoon up for grabs, and Olive will be damned if Ethan gets to enjoy paradise solo.

Agreeing to a temporary truce, the pair head for Maui. After all, ten days of bliss is worth having to assume the role of loving newlyweds, right? But the weird thing is...Olive doesn’t mind playing pretend. In fact, the more she pretends to be the luckiest woman alive, the more it feels like she might be.

Half-Fae, half-human Bryce Quinlan loves her life. By day, she works for an antiquities dealer, selling barely legal magical artifacts, and by night, she parties with her friends, savoring every pleasure Lunathion-otherwise known as Crescent City-has to offer. But it all comes crumbling down when a ruthless murder shakes the very foundations of the city-and Bryce's world. Two years later, her job has become a dead end, and she now seeks only blissful oblivion in the city's most notorious nightclubs. But when the murderer attacks again, Bryce finds herself dragged into the investigation and paired with an infamous Fallen angel whose own brutal past haunts his every step. Hunt Athalar, personal assassin for the Archangels, wants nothing to do with Bryce Quinlan, despite being ordered to protect her. She stands for everything he once rebelled against and seems more interested in partying than solving the murder, no matter how close to home it might hit. But Hunt soon realizes there's far more to Bryce than meets the eye-and that he's going to have to find a way to work with her if they want to solve this case. As Bryce and Hunt race to untangle the mystery, they have no way of knowing the threads they tug ripple through the underbelly of the city, across warring continents, and down to the darkest levels of Hel, where things that have been sleeping for millennia are beginning to stir...

She's biding her time until she's able to leave the ultra-modern city of Olympus and start her doctorate degree. The one thing she never planned on? Her mother ambushing her with an engagement to Zeus--a man with more than a few dead wives in his past. Persephone will do anything to escape that fate...even flee the sparkling upper city and make a devil's bargain with a man she once believed was a myth. Hades has spent his life in the shadows, and he has no intention of stepping into the light. Not even for the woman who flees into his territory as if the very hounds of hell are on her heels. But when he finds that Persephone can offer a little slice of the revenge he's spent his entire life craving? It's all the excuse he needs to agree to help her--for a price.

Half-Fae, half-human Bryce Quinlan loves her life. By day, she works for an antiquities dealer, selling barely legal magical artifacts, and by night, she parties with her friends, savoring every pleasure Lunathion-otherwise known as Crescent City-has to offer. But it all comes crumbling down when a ruthless murder shakes the very foundations of the city-and Bryce's world. Two years later, her job has become a dead end, and she now seeks only blissful oblivion in the city's most notorious nightclubs. But when the murderer attacks again, Bryce finds herself dragged into the investigation and paired with an infamous Fallen angel whose own brutal past haunts his every step. Hunt Athalar, personal assassin for the Archangels, wants nothing to do with Bryce Quinlan, despite being ordered to protect her. She stands for everything he once rebelled against and seems more interested in partying than solving the murder, no matter how close to home it might hit. But Hunt soon realizes there's far more to Bryce than meets the eye-and that he's going to have to find a way to work with her if they want to solve this case. As Bryce and Hunt race to untangle the mystery, they have no way of knowing the threads they tug ripple through the underbelly of the city, across warring continents, and down to the darkest levels of Hel, where things that have been sleeping for millennia are beginning to stir...

For most of the year they live far apart—she’s in New York City, and he’s in their small hometown—but every summer, for a decade, they have taken one glorious week of vacation together.
 
Until two years ago, when they ruined everything. They haven't spoken since.
 
Poppy has everything she should want, but she’s stuck in a rut. When someone asks when she was last truly happy, she knows, without a doubt, it was on that ill-fated, final trip with Alex. And so, she decides to convince her best friend to take one more vacation together—lay everything on the table, make it all right. Miraculously, he agrees.
 
Now she has a week to fix everything. If only she can get around the one big truth that has always stood quietly in the middle of their seemingly perfect relationship.

A brilliantly imaginative talent makes her exciting debut with this epic historical military fantasy, inspired by the bloody history of China’s twentieth century and filled with treachery and magic, in the tradition of Ken Liu’s Grace of Kings and N.K. Jemisin’s Inheritance Trilogy. When Rin aced the Keju—the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies—it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn’t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin’s guardians, who believed they’d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. That she got into Sinegard—the most elite military school in Nikan—was even more surprising. But surprises aren’t always good. Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power—an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive—and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school. For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away . . . Rin’s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late.",0062662597,9780062662590,un,544,2018-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,HarperCollins,,https://assets.literal.club/4/ckpoaubij729191gmzx2p5endf.jpg,"[{'id': 'ckpoaubij729201gmz268gh9w2', 'name': 'R.

In the chaotic aftermath of World War II, American college girl Charlie St. Clair is pregnant, unmarried, and on the verge of being thrown out of her very proper family.

As Queenie careens from one questionable decision to another, she finds herself wondering, “What are you doing? Why are you doing it? Who do you want to be?”—all of the questions today’s woman must face in a world trying to answer them for her.

In fact, the only thing they have in common is that for the next three months, they're living in neighboring beach houses, broke, and bogged down with writer's block. Until, one hazy evening, one thing leads to another and they strike a deal designed to force them out of their creative ruts: Augustus will spend the summer writing something happy, and January will pen the next Great American Novel. She'll take him on field trips worthy of any rom-com montage, and he'll take her to interview surviving members of a backwoods death cult (obviously).

In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue—Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself. During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.

Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story.

There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure.

By day, she works for an antiquities dealer, selling barely legal magical artifacts, and by night, she parties with her friends, savoring every pleasure Lunathion-otherwise known as Crescent City-has to offer.

The year is 1926, and Shanghai hums to the tune of debauchery. A blood feud between two gangs runs the streets red, leaving the city helpless in the grip of chaos. At the heart of it all is eighteen-year-old Juliette Cai, a former flapper who has returned to assume her role as the proud heir of the Scarlet Gang—a network of criminals far above the law. Their only rivals in power are the White Flowers, who have fought the Scarlets for generations. And behind every move is their heir, Roma Montagov, Juliette’s first love…and first betrayal. But when gangsters on both sides show signs of instability culminating in clawing their own throats out, the people start to whisper. Of a contagion, a madness. Of a monster in the shadows. As the deaths stack up, Juliette and Roma must set their guns—and grudges—aside and work together, for if they can’t stop this mayhem, then there will be no city left for either to rule.",1534457690,9781534457690,en,464,2020-11-17T00:00:00.000Z,Margaret K.

Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. An honest, evocative, and tender novel, It Ends with Us is “a glorious and touching read, a forever keeper.

For two sworn enemies, anything can happen during the Hawaiian trip of a lifetime—maybe even love—in this romantic comedy from the New York Times bestselling authors of Roomies.

Olive Torres is used to being the unlucky twin: from inexplicable mishaps to a recent layoff, her life seems to be almost comically jinxed. By contrast, her sister Ami is an eternal champion...she even managed to finance her entire wedding by winning a slew of contests. Unfortunately for Olive, the only thing worse than constant bad luck is having to spend the wedding day with the best man (and her nemesis), Ethan Thomas.

Olive braces herself for wedding hell, determined to put on a brave face, but when the entire wedding party gets food poisoning, the only people who aren’t affected are Olive and Ethan. Suddenly there’s a free honeymoon up for grabs, and Olive will be damned if Ethan gets to enjoy paradise solo.

Agreeing to a temporary truce, the pair head for Maui. After all, ten days of bliss is worth having to assume the role of loving newlyweds, right? But the weird thing is...Olive doesn’t mind playing pretend. In fact, the more she pretends to be the luckiest woman alive, the more it feels like she might be.

Frankly, she’s over it. Georgie loves planning children’s birthday parties and making people laugh, just not at her own expense. She’s determined to fix herself up into a Woman of the World... whatever that means. Phase one: new framework for her business (a website from this decade, perhaps?) Phase two: a gut-reno on her wardrobe (fyi, leggings are pants.) Phase three: updates to her exterior (do people still wax?) Phase four: put herself on the market (and stop crushing on Travis Ford!) Living her best life means facing the truth: Georgie hasn’t been on a date since, well, ever. Nobody’s asking the town clown out for a night of hot sex, that’s for sure. Maybe if people think she’s having a steamy love affair, they’ll acknowledge she’s not just the “little sister” who paints faces for a living. And who better to help demolish that image than the resident sports star and tabloid favorite. Travis Ford was major league baseball’s hottest rookie when an injury ended his career. Now he’s flipping houses to keep busy and trying to forget his glory days. But he can’t even cross the street without someone recapping his greatest hits. Or making a joke about his… bat. And then there's Georgie, his best friend’s sister, who is not a kid anymore. When she proposes a wild scheme—that they pretend to date, to shock her family and help him land a new job—he agrees. What’s the harm? It’s not like it’s real.

In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue—Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself. During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.

It seduces with its literary flair, surprises with its breath-taking plot twists, delights with its psychological insights, and challenges us to consider the corrupting consequences of racism on different communities and individual lives. I absolutely loved this book' Bernardine Evaristo, winner of the Booker Prize 2019 The Vignes twin sisters will always be identical. But after growing up together in a small, southern black community and running away at age sixteen, it's not just the shape of their daily lives that is different as adults, it's everything: their families, their communities, their racial identities. Ten years later, one sister lives with her black daughter in the same southern town she once tried to escape. The other secretly passes for white, and her white husband knows nothing of her past. Still, even separated by so many miles and just as many lies, the fates of the twins remain intertwined. What will happen to the next generation, when their own daughters' story lines intersect? Weaving together multiple strands and generations of this family, from the Deep South to California, from the 1950s to the 1990s, Brit Bennett produces a story that is at once a riveting, emotional family story and a brilliant exploration of the American history of passing. Looking well beyond issues of race, The Vanishing Half considers the lasting influence of the past as it shapes a person's decisions, desires, and expectations, and explores some of the multiple reasons and realms in which people sometimes feel pulled to live as something other than their origins.

She’s come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector.

A Bustle ""30 Best Fiction Books of 2018"" pick! A brilliantly imaginative talent makes her exciting debut with this epic historical military fantasy, inspired by the bloody history of China’s twentieth century and filled with treachery and magic, in the tradition of Ken Liu’s Grace of Kings and N.K. Jemisin’s Inheritance Trilogy. When Rin aced the Keju—the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies—it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn’t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin’s guardians, who believed they’d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. That she got into Sinegard—the most elite military school in Nikan—was even more surprising. But surprises aren’t always good. Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power—an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive—and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school. For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away . . . Rin’s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late.",0062662597,9780062662590,un,544,2018-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,HarperCollins,,https://assets.literal.club/4/ckpoaubij729191gmzx2p5endf.jpg,"[{'id': 'ckpoaubij729201gmz268gh9w2', 'name': 'R.

A substantially revised and expanded edition was published in April 1891. For the new edition, Wilde revised the content of the novel's existing chapters, divided the final chapter into two chapters, and created six entirely new additional chapters. Whereas the original edition of the novel contains 13 chapters, the revised edition of the novel contains 20 chapters. The novel tells of a young man named Dorian Gray, the subject of a painting by artist Basil Hallward. Dorian is selected for his remarkable physical beauty, and Basil becomes strongly infatuated with Dorian, believing that his beauty is responsible for a new mode of art. Talking in Basil's garden, Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil's, and becomes enthralled by Lord Henry's world view. Espousing a new kind of hedonism, Lord Henry suggests that the only thing worth pursuing in life is beauty, and the fulfillment of the senses. Realising that one day his beauty will fade, Dorian cries out, wishing that the portrait Basil has painted of him would age rather than himself. Dorian's wish is fulfilled, subsequently plunging him into a sequence of debauched acts. The portrait serves as a reminder of the effect each act has upon his soul, each sin being displayed as a new sign of aging on the portrait. The Picture of Dorian Gray is considered one of the last works of classic gothic horror fiction with a strong Faustian theme. It deals with the artistic movement of the decadents, and homosexuality, both of which caused some controversy when the book was first published. However, in modern times, the book has been referred to as ""one of the modern classics of Western literature.",1502992531,9781502992536,en,176,2014-10-26T00:00:00.000Z,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://assets.literal.club/2/ckjpraqo368360zm4udc7jopk.jpg,"[{'id': 'cki5y0wwx797510c1ervho4sd', 'name': 'Oscar Wilde', 'slug': 'oscar-wilde-ibcry', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#FDAEA1', '#FFEFB8', '#FFE0C3']",ckqupgyx30a9t01euvbbrmowr,Book

The story of the heart can never be unwritten. 

Macy Sorensen is settling into an ambitious if emotionally tepid routine: work hard as new pediatrics resident, plan her wedding to an older, financially secure man, keep her head down and heart tucked away. 

But when she runs into Elliot Petropoulos-the first and only love of her life-the careful bubble she's constructed begins to dissolve. Once upon a time, Elliot was Macy's entire world-growing from her gangly bookish friend into the man who coaxed her heart open again after the loss of her mother...only to break it on the very night he declared his love for her. 

Told in alternating timelines between Then and Now, teenage Elliot and Macy grow from friends to much more-spending weekends and lazy summers together in a house outside of San Francisco devouring books, sharing favourite words, and taking through their growing pains and triumphs. As adults, they have become strangers to one another until their chance reunion. Although their memories are obscured by agony of what happened that night so many years ago, Elliot will come to understand the truth behind Macy's decade-long silence, and will have to overcome the past and himself to revive her faith in the possibility of an all-consuming love.

""The only way to undo racism is to consistently identify and describe it--and then dismantle it."" Ibram X. Kendi's concept of antiracism reenergizes and reshapes the conversation about racial justice in America--but even more fundamentally, points us toward liberating new ways of thinking about ourselves and each other. In How to Be an Antiracist, Kendi asks us to think about what an antiracist society might look like, and how we can play an active role in building it. In this book, Kendi weaves an electrifying combination of ethics, history, law, and science, bringing it all together with an engaging personal narrative of his own awakening to antiracism. How to Be an Antiracist is an essential work for anyone who wants to go beyond an awareness of racism to the next step: contributing to the formation of a truly just and equitable society.

If Kendi is justifiably hard on America, he's just as hard on himself. . . . This unsparing honesty helps readers, both white and people of color, navigate this difficult intellectual territory. Not an easy read but an essential one.""--Kirkus Reviews (starred review) ""Ibram Kendi is today's visionary in the enduring struggle for racial justice. In this personal and revelatory new work, he yet again holds up a transformative lens, challenging both mainstream and antiracist orthodoxy.

Recommended by Entertainment Weekly, included in Good Morning America's 20 Books We're Excited for in 2020 & named as one of Vogue's Best Books to Read This Winter, Bustle's Most Anticipated Books of February 2020, and O Magazine's 14 of the Best Books to Read This February! Hailed as a “marvel of a book” and “brilliant and unflinching,” Alexis Schaitkin’s stunning debut, Saint X, is a haunting portrait of grief, obsession, and the bond between two sisters never truly given the chance to know one another. Claire is only seven years old when her college-age sister, Alison, disappears on the last night of their family vacation at a resort on the Caribbean island of Saint X. Several days later, Alison’s body is found in a remote spot on a nearby cay, and two local men–employees at the resort–are arrested. But the evidence is slim, the timeline against it, and the men are soon released. The story turns into national tabloid news, a lurid mystery that will go unsolved. For Claire and her parents, there is only the return home to broken lives. Years later, Claire is living and working in New York City when a brief but fateful encounter brings her together with Clive Richardson, one of the men originally suspected of murdering her sister. It is a moment that sets Claire on an obsessive pursuit of the truth–not only to find out what happened the night of Alison’s death but also to answer the elusive question: Who exactly was her sister? At seven, Claire had been barely old enough to know her: a beautiful, changeable, provocative girl of eighteen at a turbulent moment of identity formation. As Claire doggedly shadows Clive, hoping to gain his trust, waiting for the slip that will reveal the truth, an unlikely attachment develops between them, two people whose lives were forever marked by the same tragedy. For readers of Emma Cline’s The Girls and Lauren Groff’s Fates and Furies, Saint X is a flawlessly drawn and deeply moving story that culminates in an emotionally powerful ending.",1250219590,9781250219596,en,352,2020-02-18T00:00:00.000Z,Celadon Books,,https://assets.literal.club/2/ckro3riw5443604178fqep4ckz6.jpg,"[{'id': 'ckro3riw5443605178f717yhi9y', 'name': 'Alexis Schaitkin', 'slug': 'alexis-schaitkin-4yye4', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#ADCBF9', '#C2F5FC', '#C1F2D3']",ckwqi8e0412118291eb2xtz71pra,Book

The year is 1926, and Shanghai hums to the tune of debauchery. A blood feud between two gangs runs the streets red, leaving the city helpless in the grip of chaos. At the heart of it all is eighteen-year-old Juliette Cai, a former flapper who has returned to assume her role as the proud heir of the Scarlet Gang—a network of criminals far above the law. Their only rivals in power are the White Flowers, who have fought the Scarlets for generations. And behind every move is their heir, Roma Montagov, Juliette’s first love…and first betrayal. But when gangsters on both sides show signs of instability culminating in clawing their own throats out, the people start to whisper. Of a contagion, a madness. Of a monster in the shadows. As the deaths stack up, Juliette and Roma must set their guns—and grudges—aside and work together, for if they can’t stop this mayhem, then there will be no city left for either to rule.",1534457690,9781534457690,en,464,2020-11-17T00:00:00.000Z,Margaret K.

A residential program for bright high schoolers at UNC–Chapel Hill seems like the perfect escape—until Bree witnesses a magical attack her very first night on campus.

In this exquisite story of family, food, grief, and endurance, Michelle Zauner proves herself far more than a dazzling singer, songwriter, and guitarist. With humor and heart, she tells of growing up one of the few Asian American kids at her school in Eugene, Oregon; of struggling with her mother's particular, high expectations of her; of a painful adolescence; of treasured months spent in her grandmother's tiny apartment in Seoul, where she and her mother would bond, late at night, over heaping plates of food.

As she grew up, moving to the East Coast for college, finding work in the restaurant industry, and performing gigs with her fledgling band--and meeting the man who would become her husband--her Koreanness began to feel ever more distant, even as she found the life she wanted to live. It was her mother's diagnosis of terminal cancer, when Michelle was twenty-five, that forced a reckoning with her identity and brought her to reclaim the gifts of taste, language, and history her mother had given her.

Vivacious and plainspoken, lyrical and honest, Zauner's voice is as radiantly alive on the page as it is onstage.

But her fortunes change in an instant when billionaire Tobias Hawthorne dies and leaves Avery virtually his entire fortune. The catch? Avery has no idea why -- or even who Tobias Hawthorne is.

To receive her inheritance, Avery must move into sprawling, secret passage-filled Hawthorne House, where every room bears the old man's touch -- and his love of puzzles, riddles, and codes. Unfortunately for Avery, Hawthorne House is also occupied by the family that Tobias Hawthorne just dispossessed. This includes the four Hawthorne grandsons: dangerous, magnetic, brilliant boys who grew up with every expectation that one day, they would inherit billions. Heir apparent Grayson Hawthorne is convinced that Avery must be a conwoman, and he's determined to take her down. His brother, Jameson, views her as their grandfather's last hurrah: a twisted riddle, a puzzle to be solved. Caught in a world of wealth and privilege, with danger around every turn, Avery will have to play the game herself just to survive.

It is, above all, a way of asserting power.”—The New Yorker In 1984, London is a grim city in the totalitarian state of Oceania where Big Brother is always watching you and the Thought Police can practically read your mind. Winston Smith is a man in grave danger for the simple reason that his memory still functions. Drawn into a forbidden love affair, Winston finds the courage to join a secret revolutionary organization called The Brotherhood, dedicated to the destruction of the Party.

It is one of the funniest books ever written, a keystone work in American literature, and even added a new term to the dictionary. At the heart of Catch-22 resides the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero endlessly inventive in his schemes to save his skin from the horrible chances of war. His efforts are perfectly understandable because as he furiously scrambles, thousands of people he hasn't even met are trying to kill him. His problem is Colonel Cathcart, who keeps raising the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempts to excuse himself from the perilous missions that he is committed to flying, he is trapped by the Great Loyalty Oath Crusade, the hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule from which the book takes its title: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes the necessary formal request to be relieved of such missions, the very act of making the request proves that he is sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.

From the first moment of her freshman year at Merryweather High, Melinda knows this is a big fat lie, part of the nonsense of high school. She is friendless, outcast, because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated and practically stops talking altogether. Only her art class offers any solace, and it is through her work on an art project that she is finally able to face what really happened at that terrible party: she was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her. Her healing process has just begun when she has another violent encounter with him. But this time Melinda fights back, refuses to be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication. A timeless novel about consent and finding the courage to speak up for yourself, the twentieth anniversary edition of the classic novel that has spoken to so many young adults now includes a new introduction by acclaimed writer, host, speaker, and cultural commentator Ashley C. Ford as well as an afterword by New York Times-bestselling author of All American Boys and Long Way Down, Jason Reynolds.

Now, one of the most innovative thinkers on the planet turns to the present to make sense of today's most pressing issues. How do computers and robots change the meaning of being human? How do we deal with the epidemic of fake news? Are nations and religions still relevant? What should we teach our children? Yuval Noah Harari's 21 Lessons for the 21st Century is a probing and visionary investigation into today's most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future. As technology advances faster than our understanding of it, hacking becomes a tactic of war, and the world feels more polarized than ever, Harari addresses the challenge of navigating life in the face of constant and disorienting change and raises the important questions we need to ask ourselves in order to survive. In twenty-one accessible chapters that are both provocative and profound, Harari builds on the ideas explored in his previous books, untangling political, technological, social, and existential issues and offering advice on how to prepare for a very different future from the world we now live in: How can we retain freedom of choice when Big Data is watching us? What will the future workforce look like, and how should we ready ourselves for it? How should we deal with the threat of terrorism? Why is liberal democracy in crisis? Harari's unique ability to make sense of where we have come from and where we are going has captured the imaginations of millions of readers. Here he invites us to consider values, meaning, and personal engagement in a world full of noise and uncertainty. When we are deluged with irrelevant information, clarity is power.

Curt Wilcox knew old cars, and he knew immediately that this one was...wrong, just wrong. A few hours later, when Rafferty vanished, Wilcox and his fellow troopers knew the car was worse than dangerous -- and that it would be better if John Q. Public never found out about it. Curt's avid curiosity taking the lead, they investigated as best they could, as much as they dared. Over the years the troop absorbed the mystery as part of the background to their work, the Buick 8 sitting out there like a still life painting that breathes -- inhaling a little bit of this world, exhaling a little bit of whatever world it came from. In the fall of 2001, a few months after Curt Wilcox is killed in a gruesome auto accident, his 18-year-old boy Ned starts coming by the barracks, mowing the lawn, washing windows, shoveling snow. Sandy Dearborn, Sergeant Commanding, knows it's the boy's way of holding onto his father, and Ned is allowed to become part of the Troop D family. One day he looks in the window of Shed B and discovers the family secret.

Now she’s back with an unforgettable romantic comedy about a woman who finally has a shot at her long time crush—if she dares. Crush (n.): a strong and often short-lived infatuation, particularly for someone beyond your reach… Darcy Barrett has undertaken a global survey of men. She’s travelled the world, and can categorically say that no one measures up to Tom Valeska, whose only flaw is that Darcy’s twin brother Jamie saw him first and claimed him forever as his best friend. Despite Darcy’s best efforts, Tom’s off limits and loyal to her brother, 99%. That’s the problem with finding her dream man at age eight and peaking in her photography career at age twenty—ever since, she’s had to learn to settle for good enough. When Darcy and Jamie inherit a tumble-down cottage from their grandmother, they’re left with strict instructions to bring it back to its former glory and sell the property. Darcy plans to be in an aisle seat halfway across the ocean as soon as the renovations start, but before she can cut and run, she finds a familiar face on her porch: house-flipper extraordinaire Tom’s arrived, he’s bearing power tools, and he’s single for the first time in almost a decade. Suddenly Darcy’s considering sticking around to make sure her twin doesn’t ruin the cottage’s inherent magic with his penchant for grey and chrome. She’s definitely not staying because of her new business partner’s tight t-shirts, or that perfect face that's inspiring her to pick up her camera again. Soon sparks are flying—and it’s not the faulty wiring. It turns out one percent of Tom’s heart might not be enough for Darcy anymore. This time around, she’s switching things up. She’s going to make Tom Valeska 99 percent hers. This next hilarious romance includes a special PS section with two Happily Ever Afters—one for this novel featuring Darcy and Tom and the other, an epilogue featuring fan favorites Lucy Hutton and Josh Templeman from The Hating Game!",0062439626,9780062439628,en,368,2019-01-29T00:00:00.000Z,HarperCollins,,https://assets.literal.club/1/ckrp13w96951682178ffc056h6m.jpg,"[{'id': 'ckpikn4qg7777391ib7kwa6tg0e', 'name': 'Sally Thorne', 'slug': 'sally-thorne-fwwu9', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#E6A9E8', '#81CAFF', '#F9D0F0']",ckrdgnr6z001701su796wptfc,Book

Phoebe's the first target. If you choose not to play, it's a truth. And hers is dark.

Then comes Maeve and she should know better—always choose the dare.

But by the time Knox is about to be tagged, things have gotten dangerous. The dares have become deadly, and if Maeve learned anything from Bronwyn last year, it's that they can't count on the police for help. Or protection.

On the 30th of April 2012, a man farted in the Women’s Studies Section of a bookshop and it changed her life forever. A Book For Her details Christie’s twelve years of anonymous toil in the bowels of stand-up comedy and the sudden epiphany that made her, unbelievably, one of the most critically acclaimed British stand-up comedians this decade, drawing together the threads that link a smelly smell in the women’s studies section to the global feminist struggle. Find out how nice Peter Stringfellow’s fish tastes, how yoghurt advertising perpetuates rape myths, and how Emily Bronte used a special ladies’ pen to write Wuthering Heights. If you’re interested in comedy and feminism, then this is definitely the book for you.

But soon she finds herself adrift in Wedding Land, a world where all brides are expected to want to look like Cinderella, where women plan weddings with fantasy butterfly themes, where a woman's wedding is, without question, the Happiest Day of Her Life. Despite her best efforts not to become a Bridezilla, Hana finds herself transformed from a thirty-year-old woman with a 401(k) into a nearly unrecognizable version of herself as she spends weeks crafting save-the-date cards, worries about matching her cocktails to her wedding colors, and obsessively reads Martha Stewart Weddings magazine. She decides that, if she is going to follow traditions like wearing white and walking down the aisle with flowers, she at least wants to understand why. In her search she turns up interesting wedding facts: bridesmaids, for instance, were originally recruited to confuse evil spirits. Ultimately, she casts a critical eye on the $72 billion wedding industry, from the women at wedding websites who cackle over the etiquette missteps of others to wedding magazines that provide checklists of 187 tasks to plan the perfect wedding, suggesting that to have anything less is to fail as a bride, as a woman, as a wife.

The book is organized with a visual and context content so that reader can easily relate to the experience of the author. The book is divided into three sections: Random Thoughts, Nature Gallery and Travel Diary. Random Thoughts are based on observations and life experiences of the author as part of his understanding of his own life and people around him. There is also outpouring of thought as a result of his seeking deeper meaning to life observation. The connectivity amongst different sensory information can also be seen in the poems. The various hues of literary brush strokes combine to provide a highly aesthetic object of art, where one can see a specific dimension akin to his or her taste. There are verses inspired by philosophical enquiry, observation of art and sensitivities brought to the surface by books read. Close friendship and family relations have also inspired some of the poems in this section. Nature Gallery sections deals with author's intimate observation of events that unfold around him in his natural surroundings. The monsoon in India, autumn colours in Europe, mountains and valleys, flock of birds in the sky, rock formations, a lone Baobab tree against the setting sun and the Leonid shower have all inspired the verses in this section. As the author had travelled extensively during his work and holidays, his experiences of places and people and their significance is brought out in poetry. The quiet ruins of Tintern Abbey, castles of North Wales, River Dart originating in the moors of Devon, the surreal ambience of the Hoysala Temples of Karnataka in South India, historical reminiscence of events in Venice and many more locales have spurred the verses in this section. This section and the book ends with a set of short verses bordering on the limerick on the infamous shores on Devonshire where smuggling was rampant in the past.",1412052009,9781412052009,en,108,2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,Barnabas Tiburtius,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NhqJSanPhBAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'id': 'ckrt6jkzr309141gug1gp3iya5', 'name': 'Barnabas Tiburtius', 'slug': 'barnabas-tiburtius-4o1va', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#E6A9E8', '#81CAFF', '#F9D0F0']",cl9fpnlc21472949f9izi5vt1ndz,Book

Today, no collection of signals or observations—even from satellites, which can “see” the whole planet with a single instrument—becomes global in time and space without passing through a series of data models.

Sandberg and her two young children were devastated, and she was certain that their lives would never have real joy or meaning again. Just weeks later, Sandberg was talking with a friend about the first father-child activity without a father. They came up with a plan for someone to fill in. “But I want Dave,” she cried. Her friend put his arm around her and said, “Option A is not available. So let’s just kick the shit out of Option B.” Everyone experiences some form of Option B. We all deal with loss: jobs lost, loves lost, lives lost. The question is not whether these things will happen but how we face them when they do. Thoughtful, honest, revealing and warm, OPTION B weaves Sandberg’s experiences coping with adversity with new findings from Adam Grant and other social scientists. The book features stories of people who recovered from personal and professional hardship, including illness, injury, divorce, job loss, sexual assault and imprisonment. These people did more than recover—many of them became stronger. OPTION B offers compelling insights for dealing with hardships in our own lives and helping others in crisis. It turns out that post-traumatic growth is common—even after the most devastating experiences many people don’t just bounce back but actually bounce forward. And pre-traumatic growth is also possible: people can build resilience even if they have not experienced tragedy. Sandberg and Grant explore how we can raise strong children, create resilient communities and workplaces, and find meaning, love and joy in our lives. “Dave’s death changed me in very profound ways,” Sandberg writes. “I learned about the depths of sadness and the brutality of loss.

The catalogue entries provide detailed historical and iconographical information on the medals, many of which are published for the first time.

Apart from the obvious effects of vitamin D deficiency on skeletal metabolism, the problem is assuming even greater significance because observational and interventional studies have linked vitamin D deficiency to cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. This book addresses a variety of important issues that have emerged from this fast-moving area of clinical medicine. The topics include assays of vitamin D and its binding protein, effects on aging and associated complications, primary and secondary states of altered parathyroid hormone secretion, vitamin D in the growing years of children and adolescents, nutritional requirements, and vitamin D as it relates to systemic disorders such as diabetes mellitus.

The topics covered include: data acquisition, data quality assessment, filling holes, 3D reconstruction, SLAM, multiple depth camera systems, segmentation, object detection, salience detection, pose estimation, geometric modelling, fall detection, autonomous driving, motor rehabilitation therapy, people counting and cognitive service robots. The availability of cheap RGB-D sensors has led to an explosion over the last five years in the capture and application of colour plus depth data. The addition of depth data to regular RGB images vastly increases the range of applications, and has resulted in a demand for robust and real-time processing of RGB-D data. There remain many technical challenges, and RGB-D image processing is an ongoing research area. This book covers the full state of the art, and consists of a series of chapters by internationally renowned experts in the field. Each chapter is written so as to provide a detailed overview of that topic.

Yet, not even the most stiff-necked Southern patrician can deny that D. Wayne Lukas is the most successful horse trainer in history. In 1999, Lukas became the first trainer to surpass $200 million in earnings. He has won 12 Triple Crown events (including 6 in a row)13 Breeders' Cups, 4 Kentucky Derbies, 5 Preaknesses, and 3 Belmonts. If horse racing is the sport of kings, then D. Wayne Lukas is surely its emperor. Now, in D. Wayne--the first book-length biography of D. Wayne Lukas--sportswriter Carlo DeVito tells the riveting life story of the man known throughout the sports world as the ""Vince Lombardi of horse racing.""He reveals the unorthodox business tactics D. Wayne used to wrest control of thoroughbred racing away from the handful of wealthy families who had held it for two centuries and to change the business forever.

While there has been much written about drawing the human form in relation to art, commercial design, and 2-D cartooning, the subject of 3-D modeling and animation of the human form has been neglected at the same time that the use of 3-D tools has been exploding. It is my judgment that [this] book will become the reference that professional and student artists and animators turn to in order to master one of the most challenging yet exciting subjects to model and animate-the human form."" -Nick Pavlovic, CEO, Visual Information Development, Inc., Monrovia, CA Ideal for graphic designers, artists, and others, 3-D Human Modeling and Animation builds a bridge from traditional figure drawing, painting, and sculpture to the creation and animation of figures using computer technology. With a step-by-step approach, the book leads readers through the process of modeling human figures, with specific yet flexible techniques that can be applied to many different hardware/software setups. Separate chapters cover different areas of the body, and contain everything readers need to know about proportion, basic design strategies, 3-D construction methods, and other essential information. The final chapters show how to prepare figures for animation and get them up and running-and jumping, walking, turning, and twisting!

This key topic has received considerable attention within research literature and has been studied by a number of leading experts in the field. This book is positioned at the heart of these debates and offers a specific contribution to ‘exploring’ and ‘exploiting’ the learning gap which feedback seeks to shift. Developing Feedback for Pupil Learning seeks to synthesise what we know about feedback and learning into more in-depth understandings of what influences both the structure of and changes to the learning gap. This research-informed but accessibly written enquiry is at the very heart of teaching, learning and assessment. It offers a timely contribution to understanding what works (and what doesn’t) for whom and why. Split into three main parts, it covers: Feedback for learning in theory, policy and practice; Conceptualising the ‘learning gap’; New futures for feedback.

Il volume, pur conservando l’originaria agilità di consultazione, fornisce una trattazione completa ed esaustiva del quadro di riferimento per la qualificazione e quantificazione dei redditi di lavoro dipendente ed assimilati, ne analizza le varie fattispecie che si possono incontrare nella pratica professionale, con particolare attenzione alla disciplina delle trasferte, e le relative modalità di rimborso degli oneri sostenuti dai dipendenti, e a quella dei fringe benefits. L’ultimo capitolo è stato riservato all’esame della disciplina della deducibilità, sia ai fini delle imposte dirette (Irpef/Ires) sia ai fini IRAP, degli oneri connessi ai dipendenti e collaboratori, per aiutare nella determinazione degli importi deducibili specie quelli la cui deduzione è soggetta a limitazioni.

Torrance, who is generally considered to have been one of the most significant theologians writing in English during the twentieth century, with a view toward showing how his theological method and all his major doctrinal views were shaped by his understanding of the doctrine of the Trinity. Torrance pursued a theology that was realist because he attempted to think in accordance with the unique nature of the object that is known. In holding to such a methodology, he drew an analogy between theology and natural science. This book demonstrates how, for Torrance, God relates with humanity within time and space so that creation finds its meaning in relation to God and not in itself; this enabled him to avoid many theological pitfalls such as agnosticism, subjectivism and dualism while explaining the positive implications of various Christian doctrines in a penetrating and compelling manner. This book offers an important resource for students of theology and for scholars who are interested in seeing how serious dogmatic theology shapes and should shape our understanding of the Christian life.",1317010477,9781317010470,en,382,2016-02-17T00:00:00.000Z,Routledge,,https://assets.literal.club/1/cksoe7ufq235281excfoyzw9pl.jpg,"[{'id': 'cksoe7ufq235291exc6xb4hqdq', 'name': 'Paul D.

He cherishes diversity and differences of opinion and he shuns extremism. . . . My hope is that history will show he was closer to the mark than the Republican Party of today."" ---Congressman Sandy Levin ""This is an outstanding and long-overdue biography of a man who set the standard for how a political figure should behave in a civilized society. Anyone who wants to understand modern Michigan history-or who wants to know how our politics and government could be better today-ought to read this book."" ---Jack Lessenberry William Milliken, Michigan's longest-serving governor, stands as an icon of decency even among the state's most cynical political observers. Often seen by the public as a man above politics, Milliken was in truth an astute deal maker who governed by crafting coalitions with politicians that spanned the gamut from Detroit's hard-left Coleman Young to the rural conservatives of his own Republican Party. Born in Traverse City, Michigan, Milliken fought in World War II and returned home to run the family business, served as lieutenant governor from 1965 to 1969, and was then elected to four-year terms in 1970, 1974, and 1978. Milliken stepped down after fourteen years and a record of education reform, environmental protection, urban policy, and civil rights-and a series of bruising tax fights. Twenty years after leaving office Milliken's legacy of civility and willingness to work with political opponents stands tall. But his outspoken defense of traditional Republican values has cast him into a political no-man's land that makes this story as intensely emotional as it is relevant to today's no-holds barred politics. Dave Dempsey presents a fully developed picture of Milliken that reveals both his strengths and weaknesses while also providing the political and historical context of Milliken's time in office-and the lessons of his life and career for current and future politicians and the public. Dave Dempsey serves as Communications Director for Conservation Minnesota and consults for other environmental and conservation organizations across Minnesota and Michigan. He is author of William G.

His encounter with the mysterious Brotherhood of Watchers drives him to the crusades, into a clash with the Doge in Venice and on to the disaster of Constantinople. But there is more to Walter than he dares imagine? What are the dark forces controlling him and those he loves? The story is wrenched into the present where a sinister Oxford don dies in mysterious circumstances leaving an occult manuscript based on Walter to his assistant Ian with certain instructions. As Ian seeks to unravel these and his own life and love begin to weave into Walter’s – to whom he bears a striking resemblance – the novel’s secrets deepen. This is a powerful and compelling tale about personal and political catastrophe and the individual’s resilience in a time of uncertainty and danger. It is also a daring and brilliant contemplation of the Middle Ages and its continuing importance. Walter’s work, it appears, is not finished, nor what he learnt, nor is his music lost forever.",1861515391,9781861515391,en,492,2015-11-01T00:00:00.000Z,Memoirs Publishing,,https://assets.literal.club/2/cku328svq3859813ykavdct3ca.jpg,"[{'id': 'cku328svq3859913yks7f1l7pg', 'name': 'T J Armstrong', 'slug': 't-j-armstrong-g9ghz', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#93D4FF', '#E2F1B7', '#E8F09D']",cl9fnxukp957693f9izg53la773,Book

But while GPCRs serve as targets for more than 300 medicines in the modern pharmacopoeia, the shrinking pool of known ligands and the continuing discovery of orphan GPCR genes have underscored the need for new approaches to ligand identification. Identification and Expression of G Protein-Coupled Receptors addresses this new direction in GPCR biochemistry-offering a definitive laboratory bench manual that emphasizes expression over primary cloning strategies. In a series of expert contributions by well-known researchers, this book provides detailed protocols for various expression systems-from bacteria to mammalian cells-as well as straightforward opinions on the advantages and shortcomings of each approach. Topics covered include: * Homology screening and the polymerase chain reaction in the cloning of GPCR genes * Cloning of GPCRs using mammalian cell expression * GPCR informatics and the orphan problem * The use of Xenopus laevis oocytes for the study of GPCRs * Stable expression of GPCRs in mammalian cells * Heterologous expression in primary cell cultures * Expression of GPCR in Escherichia coli * Large scale expression and purification of GPCRs in mammalian cells * High-level expression of GPCRs in the Baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system * Expression of GPCRs in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells * Methods for genetic analysis and ligand identification using heterologous GPCRs expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Supplemented with numerous photographs and illustrations, Identification and Expression of G Protein-Coupled Receptors is important reading for biochemists, pharmacologists, neuroscientists, structural biologists, and anyone involved in GPCR-based research.

Moreover, simple national accounting identities reveal that a country's current account balance reflects its savings-investment imbalance. Thus, differences in national age-profiles should affect the current account. To test this theory's plausibility and significance, I simulate a multi-region overlapping generations model that is calibrated to match the demographic differences among the major industrialized countries over the past 50 years. In the model, it is found that these differences can explain some of the observed long-term capital movements in the G-7. In particular, the model does a good job of predicting the size and timing of American current account deficits as well as Japanese current account surpluses.",,,en,25,2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LnZaAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'id': 'cl2ggzsk51611370hq0xvcuv9t5', 'name': 'Michael Feroli', 'slug': 'michael-feroli-d0pn3', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#FF99BE', '#DCC7F5', '#FAAFE0']",cl9ib62ig114377524hl94373orq,Book

Beginning with the history of the prayer, we progress through an analysis of the types of Sal h, its spiritual and physical benefits, and a unique step-by-step guide on learning to pray for those new to the practice. With this book, there should no longer be any confusion or lack of knowledge regarding Sal h.

In 1946 Piper appeared seemingly from out of nowhere, already at the top of his form. He published a number of memorable short stories in the premier science fiction magazine of the time, Astounding Science Fiction, under legendary editor John W. Campbell. Piper quickly became friends with many of the top writers of the day, including Lester Del Rey, Fletcher Pratt, Robert Heinlein and L. Sprague de Camp. Piper also successfully made the turn from promising short story writer to major novelist, authoring Four-Day Planet, Cosmic Computer, Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen and Little Fuzzy, which was nominated for a Hugo award. Even those who counted Piper among their friends knew very little about the man or his life as a railroad yard bull in Altoona, Pennsylvania. This biography illuminates H. Beam Piper, both the writer and the man, and answers lingering questions about his death.

White and His World,"The Art & Craft of Photography, 1895-1925","Restoring a gifted art photographer to his place in the American canon and, in the process, reshaping and expanding our understanding of early 20th-century American photography Clarence H. White (1871–1925) was one of the most influential art photographers and teachers of the early 20th century and a founding member of the Photo-Secession. This beautiful publication offers a new appraisal of White’s contributions, including his groundbreaking aesthetic experiments, his commitment to the ideals of American socialism, and his embrace of the expanding fields of photographic book and fashion illustration, celebrity portraiture, and advertising. Based on extensive archival research, the book challenges the idea of an abrupt rupture between prewar, soft-focus idealizing photography and postwar “modernism” to paint a more nuanced picture of American culture in the Progressive era. Clarence H. White and His World begins with the artist’s early work in Ohio, which shares with the nascent Arts and Crafts movement the advocacy of hand production, closeness to nature, and the simple life. White’s involvement with the Photo-Secession and his move to New York in 1906 mark a shift in his production, as it grew to encompass commercial portraiture and an increasing commitment to teaching, which ultimately led him to establish the first institutions in America to combine instruction in both technical and aesthetic aspects of photography. The book also incorporates new formal and scientific analysis of White’s work and techniques, a complete exhibition record, and many unpublished illustrations of the moody outdoor scenes and quiet images of domestic life for which he was revered.",0300229089,9780300229080,en,408,2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,Yale University Press,,https://assets.literal.club/2/cks4mt36f1989111evnovn3z9p5.jpg,"[{'id': 'cks4mt36f1989121evn9hgw1i9o', 'name': 'Anne McCauley', 'slug': 'anne-mccauley-cycoj', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#93D4FF', '#E2F1B7', '#E8F09D']",ckwqqhzzn3580831eb24lvhmcee,Book

But the silence about death in America is a lost opportunity for people to find insight and support in walking ""that lonesome valley."" In Befriending Death, over 100 writers respond, in one page each, to one question: In the face of death, how do you find meaning and fulfillment in life? Penned from people from a variety of backgrounds, the essays take death seriously and openly and discuss how the authors find meaning in life. This chance for a rare sharing of views on a truly profound subject has attracted commentators who are deeply religious and those who are not religious, noted authors and people who have never published a word, people celebrated by the world and people ignored by the world. As they are all equal in their mortality, they are equal in striving for an authentic existence and an honest description of what for them constitutes fulfillment. While each essay in Befriending Death is unique, together they present a tapestry of courage, struggle, and insight. At a time when we are often overwhelmed by the eagerness of people to provide their opinions on politics and sports, here is a rare opportunity to hear people share their most profound views on life and death.",1491740485,9781491740484,en,282,2014-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,iUniverse,,https://assets.literal.club/2/cksw1qscg280581dwgvgiir5s3.jpg,"[{'id': 'cksw1qscg280591dwg4wkcs7oo', 'name': 'Matrinna Woods', 'slug': 'matrinna-woods-ozcd6', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#B0DAF2', '#FFF4CF', '#B1D6B0']",cl9frbq0f85819htize82kjkm0,Book

Leaders of the glam rock movement, Slade were the UK s biggest singles band in the years 1971-74. Their many hits have become rock n roll standards, not least Merry Christmas Everybody , arguably Britain s all-time favourite Christmas song. For Don Powell, though, success came at a price. Lucky to survive, the aftermath of his accident included alcoholism, financial woes and a life of reckless promiscuity.

""I never think except when I sit down to write."" -- Attributed to Montaigne by Edgar Allan Poe From Montaigne in the sixteenth century to Orwell, Eliot, and Trilling in the twentieth, the best literary essayists combine a gift for observation with an abiding commitment to books. Although it may seem that books are becoming less essential and that a revolution in sensibility is taking place, the essays of Arthur Krystal suggest otherwise. Companionable without being chummy, engaged without being didactic, erudite without being stuffy, he demonstrates that literature, even in the digital age, remains the truest expression of the human condition. Covering subjects as diverse as aphorisms, dueling, the night, and the 1960s, the essays gathered here offer the common reader uncommon pleasure. In prose that is both vibrant and elegant, Krystal negotiates among myriad subjects-from historical writing as exemplified by Jacques Barzun to the art of screenwriting as not so happily represented by F. Scott Fitzgerald. His cardinal rule as a writer? William Hazlitt's ""Confound it, man, don't be insipid."" No fear of that. Except When I Write is thoughtful in the most joyful sense-brimming with ideas in order to give us the flow and cadence of someone actually thinking. Keenly observant and death on pretension, Krystal examines the world of books without ever losing sight of the world beyond them. Literature may be the bedrock on which these essays rest, but as F. R. Leavis aptly noted, ""One cannot seriously be interested in literature and remain purely literary in interests."" Except When I Write is a reminder of both the pleasure and the power of a well-tuned essay.",0199782628,9780199782628,en,208,2011-06-01T00:00:00.000Z,Oxford University Press,,https://assets.literal.club/1/cksiq1rne178201fxp46wd39b8.jpg,"[{'id': 'cksiq1rnf178211fxp8sz1now1', 'name': 'Arthur Krystal', 'slug': 'arthur-krystal-cjp2y', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#ADCBF9', '#C2F5FC', '#C1F2D3']",ckwqy9p9o10419791eb2yfk1s1wk,Book

To get maximum benefit from this Guide, you should begin by spending a few moments to acquaint yourself with its structure. Once you get started in the course, take advantage of the many opportunities which the text and Student Guide together provide for learning calculus in the only way that any mathe matical subject can truly be mastered - through attempting to solve problems on your own.

From southeast Washington, DC, where the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers meet, Fort Lesley J. McNair still protects America's capital. In 1791, Pierre L'Enfant designated it as a military reservation. The post is the third oldest in continuous operation--as an arsenal, a penitentiary, a hospital, and now, a military education center. It was renamed in 1948 to honor Lt. Gen. Lesley J. McNair, who was killed in World War II. Over the course of two centuries, the fort has borne witness to the British ransacking during the War of 1812; a Civil War explosion that killed female arsenal workers; and the incarceration, trial, and hanging of Lincoln assassination conspirators.

En opposition avec les modernes, les Anciens s'efforcent d'couter la nature. Respecter l'harmonie naturelle devient la rgle d'or de l'homme ancien qui s'vertue l'appliquer dans toutes les manifestations de sa vie individuelle et sociale. L'humanisme ancien est fond sur l'altrit dissemblable. Pour cet humanisme, l'autre est celui qui ne possde pas la culture du juste (athmistos), le barbare, donc celui qui, au lieu de pratiquer la vertu, s'applique l'exercice de la violence. Cette culture, comprenant la fois une dimension thique et juridique, transforme une vie d'anarchie et de laideur, symptmes de l'injustice, en une vie d'quilibre et de beaut piliers de la justice et du droit. Contrairement l'humanisme d'aujourd'hui fond sur la ressemblance des visages et sur l'galit des existences, l'humanisme hellnique est fond sur la dissemblance.

The following matters are studied: the general and specific factors that have fuelled restructuring in Canadian firms; the general pattern of restructuring practices and the forms of restructuring; reasons for successful restructuring in some companies, and whether Canadian firms can learn from such experience; and the effects of restructuring on company profitability, productivity, and employment.

With each chapter containing new content, readers are provided with new material on reduction, orbifolds, and the regularization of the Kepler problem, all of which are provided with applications. The previous editions grew out of graduate level courses in mathematics, engineering, and physics given at several different universities. The courses took students who had some background in differential equations and lead them through a systematic grounding in the theory of Hamiltonian mechanics from a dynamical systems point of view. This text provides a mathematical structure of celestial mechanics ideal for beginners, and will be useful to graduate students and researchers alike. Reviews of the second edition: ""The primary subject here is the basic theory of Hamiltonian differential equations studied from the perspective of differential dynamical systems. The N-body problem is used as the primary example of a Hamiltonian system, a touchstone for the theory as the authors develop it. This book is intended to support a first course at the graduate level for mathematics and engineering students. ... It is a well-organized and accessible introduction to the subject ... . This is an attractive book ... ."" (William J. Satzer, The Mathematical Association of America, March, 2009) “The second edition of this text infuses new mathematical substance and relevance into an already modern classic ... and is sure to excite future generations of readers. ... This outstanding book can be used not only as an introductory course at the graduate level in mathematics, but also as course material for engineering graduate students. ... it is an elegant and invaluable reference for mathematicians and scientists with an interest in classical and celestial mechanics, astrodynamics, physics, biology, and related fields.” (Marian Gidea, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2010 d)",3319536915,9783319536910,en,384,2017-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,Springer,,https://assets.literal.club/1/ckgc9xb2b2925107888reg1rw.jpg,"[{'id': 'ckgc9xb2b29261078mn1ajy7d', 'name': 'Kenneth R.

The idea to hold this conference grew out of a program at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility to study the (p,n) reaction in the 50-200 MeV energy range. The first new Indiana data, in contrast to low energy data, showed features suggestive of a dominant one pion exchange interaction. It seemed desir able to review what was known about the fre·e and the effective nucleon-nucleon force and the connection between the low and high energy (p,n) data. Thus the conference was born. The following people served as the organizing committee: S. M. Austin, Michigan State University W. Bertozzi, Massachusetts Institute of Technology S. D. Bloom, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory C. C. Foster, Indiana University C. D. Goodman, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Conference Chairman) D. A. Lind, University of Colorado J. Rapaport, Ohio University G. R.

(1) NHCs were found to be efficient catalysts for the [4+2] annulation of β-substituted nitroalkenes. The scope of Rauhut–Currier reaction was successfully extended to the most challenging β-substituted alkenes by this method; (2) Enals were successfully used for [4+2] annulations with azodicarboxylates catalyzed by NHC via γ-addition. Highly enantiopure tetrahydropyridazinones and γ-amino acid derivatives could be easily prepared by subsequent transformations of the resulting dihydropyridazinones. (4) The readily available α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids were first successfully employed to generate the α,β-unsaturated acyl azolium intermediates by using NHC for the enantioselective [3+2] and [3+3] annulations.",9811028990,9789811028991,en,123,2016-12-20T00:00:00.000Z,Springer,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qgPGDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'id': 'cktflx17a31860913xif48am0dq', 'name': 'Xiangyu Chen', 'slug': 'xiangyu-chen-vb67y', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#B0DAF2', '#FFF4CF', '#B1D6B0']",cl9frdbjm123607htizba1g41sx,Book

The O’Briens’ original footnotes and authorial digressions detail the failure of colonial policy in Ireland, contributing to the novel’s long-standing reputation as a credible historical account of the turbulent 1790s.

Hirschman, one of the twentieth century's most original and provocative thinkers. In this gripping biography, Jeremy Adelman tells the story of a man shaped by modern horrors and hopes, a worldly intellectual who fought for and wrote in defense of the values of tolerance and change. Born in Berlin in 1915, Hirschman grew up amid the promise and turmoil of the Weimar era, but fled Germany when the Nazis seized power in 1933. Amid hardship and personal tragedy, he volunteered to fight against the fascists in Spain and helped many of Europe's leading artists and intellectuals escape to America after France fell to Hitler. His intellectual career led him to Paris, London, and Trieste, and to academic appointments at Columbia, Harvard, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was an influential adviser to governments in the United States, Latin America, and Europe, as well as major foundations and the World Bank. Along the way, he wrote some of the most innovative and important books in economics, the social sciences, and the history of ideas. Throughout, he remained committed to his belief that reform is possible, even in the darkest of times. This is the first major account of Hirschman's remarkable life, and a tale of the twentieth century as seen through the story of an astute and passionate observer. Adelman's riveting narrative traces how Hirschman's personal experiences shaped his unique intellectual perspective, and how his enduring legacy is one of hope, open-mindedness, and practical idealism""--",0691155674,9780691155678,en,740,2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,Princeton University Press,,https://assets.literal.club/2/cksxgnh30126381fzrm997sqm3.jpg,"[{'id': 'cksvusoc7104611ezrb7kdjtx5', 'name': 'Jeremy Adelman', 'slug': 'jeremy-adelman-v2b7m', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#B0DAF2', '#FFF4CF', '#B1D6B0']",ckwr5dbtv16659711eb2b3wiudrp,Book

Whether it was stapling his nutsack to his leg or diving into a pool full of elephant crap, almost nothing was out of bounds. As the stunts got crazier, his life kept pace. He developed a crippling addiction to drugs and alcohol, and an obsession with his own celebrity that proved nearly as dangerous. Only an intervention and a visit to a psychiatric ward saved his life. Today he has been clean and sober for more than three years. Professional Idiot recounts the lunacy, the debauchery, the stunts, the drug addiction, and the path to recovery with bravado, humor, and heart.

The definitions of these interfaces are being elaborated in harmony with international standardization efforts in this field. One principal goal of the project is to develop techniques for the exchange of CAD information between CAD systems, and from the CAD domain to CAA (Computer Aided Analysis) and CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing). This volume presents a proposal for a neutral file format for CAD data: curves, surfaces, and solids. The specification is based on a reference schema for CAD data bases and is defined informally with respect to its semantics and formally with respect to its syntax. This volume is a revised edition of ""Specification of a CAD*I Neutral File for Solids"" Version 3.2. The revision reflects the enhancements which result from the implementation of communication processors in eight different CAD systems and from the practical exchange of solid models between these systems.

A correspondingly diverse range of mathematical techniques is being successfully applied, leading to new results and pointing to exciting new directions of research. In this work important theoretical developments are carefully presented by leading mathematicians in the field, bringing the reader to the cutting edge of current research.

What do you know about p-adic numbers? Probably, you have never used any p-adic (nonrational) number before now. I was in the same situation few years ago. p-adic numbers were considered as an exotic part of pure mathematics without any application. I have also used only real and complex numbers in my investigations in functional analysis and its applications to the quantum field theory and I was sure that these number fields can be a basis of every physical model generated by nature. But recently new models of the quantum physics were proposed on the basis of p-adic numbers field Qp. What are p-adic numbers, p-adic analysis, p-adic physics, p-adic probability? p-adic numbers were introduced by K. Hensel (1904) in connection with problems of the pure theory of numbers. The construction of Qp is very similar to the construction of (p is a fixed prime number, p = 2,3,5, ... ,127, ... ). Both these number fields are completions of the field of rational numbers Q.

Also explored is the complexity of historical and contemporary influences that give shape to p’ansori as a ‘living tradition’ across the ages and into the present, and as a cultural icon with an enduring narrative and emotional impact. Social, economic and political dynamics are created in the nexus of traditional feudal values, colonial modernity and nationalism. The impact of aspects of late modernity such as technology, mass media, migration and globalization, has transported p’ansori into digital and transnational domains.

For that reason an understanding of Q and its variation with position in the earth and with time should provide information on earth's tectonic evolution, as well as on aspects of its internal structure. Papers of this volume present new information on Q in the earth from several perspectives: methodology, results from global and regional observations of both body and surface waves, laboratory measurements, and theoretical understanding.

Generally, the bulky Gasper-Rahman notation was used, but the published works on q-calculus looked different depending on where and by whom they were written. This confusion of tongues not only complicated the theoretical development but also contributed to q-calculus remaining a neglected mathematical field. This book overcomes these problems by introducing a new and interesting notation for q-calculus based on logarithms.For instance, q-hypergeometric functions are now visually clear and easy to trace back to their hypergeometric parents. With this new notation it is also easy to see the connection between q-hypergeometric functions and the q-gamma function, something that until now has been overlooked. The book covers many topics on q-calculus, including special functions, combinatorics, and q-difference equations. Apart from a thorough review of the historical development of q-calculus, this book also presents the domains of modern physics for which q-calculus is applicable, such as particle physics and supersymmetry, to name just a few.​",3034804318,9783034804318,en,492,2012-09-13T00:00:00.000Z,Springer Science & Business Media,,https://assets.literal.club/2/ckv00vcgu123411013sr14mdorq0.jpg,"[{'id': 'cksp4bhtx793721fx3xexz2n1q', 'name': 'Thomas Ernst', 'slug': 'thomas-ernst-jp20x', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#FF99BE', '#DCC7F5', '#FAAFE0']",cl9h2st2v7488280on9xfy9qo5z,Book

As an extension of a neutrosophic set, the Q-neutrosophic set was introduced to handle two-dimensional uncertain and inconsistent situations. We extend the soft expert set to generalized Q-neutrosophic soft expert set by incorporating the idea of soft expert set to the concept of Q-neutrosophic set and attaching the parameter of fuzzy set while defining a Q-neutrosophic soft expert set. This pattern carries the benefits of Q-neutrosophic sets and soft sets, enabling decision makers to recognize the views of specialists with no requirement for extra lumbering tasks, thus making it exceedingly reasonable for use in decision-making issues that include imprecise, indeterminate and inconsistent two-dimensional data. Some essential operations namely subset, equal, complement, union, intersection, AND and OR operations and additionally several properties relating to the notion of generalized Q-neutrosophic soft expert set are characterized. Finally, an algorithm on generalized Q-neutrosophic soft expert set is proposed and applied to a real-life example to show the efficiency of this notion in handling such problems.",,,en,16,2021-10-30T15:16:24.044Z,Infinite Study,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vx7UDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'id': 'ckvcfo6oy16194621fuqsampsabp', 'name': 'Nasruddin Hassan', 'slug': 'nasruddin-hassan-7i4jm', '__typename': 'Author'}, {'id': 'ckvdy62403427151fwb6y1qpus1', 'name': 'Majdoleen Abu Qamar ', 'slug': 'majdoleen-abu-qamar-d35dd', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#93D4FF', '#E2F1B7', '#E8F09D']",cl9fqi57c507277f9izfgqagj7r,Book

Specifically, the study examined how their Q-sort descriptions vary as a function of the race of the target and the Afrocentricity of the judges. Template Q-sorts were developed to represent the collective judgment of a group of individual judges' Q- sorts. When the conventional Q-sort template matching method was used to analyze the data, the template Q-sorts of optimal mental health were virtually the same regardless of the target of the sort (European American or African American) or the psychologists' level of Afrocentricity (high or low). Furthermore, African American psychologists' conceptualizations of optimal mental health were also essentially the same as European American clinical psychologists' (Block, 1961) description of optimal mental health. A unique aspect of this study is that the data were also analyzed using an ANOVA model. By assessing the levels of variance within various groups of individual Q-sorts and the variance between groups, it was determined that it is possible for templates to be highly correlated and significantly different. Finally, although the templates were highly similar, participants reported that they believed optimal mental health was different for an African American and a European American. Thus, the appropriateness of using the CQ-set to conceptualize optimal mental health from a non-Eurocentric perspective is explored.",,,en,300,1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yUUdAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'id': 'ckufi9pqz27645413u4jb6mtes1', 'name': 'Antoinette Elizabeth Kavanaugh', 'slug': 'antoinette-elizabeth-kavanaugh-dnlp4', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#E6A9E8', '#81CAFF', '#F9D0F0']",cl9fo9x501348917f9izzwi4nvjk,Book

It's impossible to know what you will do... Every child's potential is regularly determined by a standardized measurement: their quotient (Q). Score high enough, and attend a top tier school with a golden future. Score too low, and it's off to a federal boarding school with limited prospects afterwards. The purpose? An improved society where education costs drop, teachers focus on the more promising students, and parents are happy. When your child is taken from you. Elena Fairchild is a teacher at one of the state's elite schools. When her nine-year-old daughter bombs a monthly test and her Q score drops to a disastrously low level, she is immediately forced to leave her top school for a federal institution hundreds of miles away. As a teacher, Elena thought she understood the tiered educational system, but as a mother whose child is now gone, Elena's perspective is changed forever. She just wants her daughter back.

Having fun requires challenges that wake up the learner’s curiosity but also provide an emotional reward on overcoming them. This book is designed so that it includes smaller and bigger challenges, in what I call playgrounds, in the hope that all readers will enjoy their path to R fluency. Fluency in the use of a language is a skill that is acquired through practice and exploration. Although rarely mentioned separately, fluency in a computer programming language involves both writing and reading. The parallels between natural and computer languages are many, but differences are also important. For students and professionals in the biological sciences, humanities, and many applied fields, recognizing the parallels between R and natural languages should help them feel at home with R. The approach I use is similar to that of a travel guide, encouraging exploration and describing the available alternatives and how to reach them. The intention is to guide the reader through the R landscape of 2020 and beyond.

Both on-shell (at the mass of around 125 GeV) and off-shell (above 200 GeV) Higgs boson production is studied and an excess of off-shell production with significance above two standard deviations is observed for the first time. The latter is a qualitative new way to study the Higgs field, responsible for generation of mass of all the known elementary particles. In addition, phenomenological tools have been developed with the Monte Carlo event generator and matrix element techniques for an optional analysis of LHC data. Optimization of the CMS data with careful alignment of the silicon tracker is also presented.",3030254747,9783030254742,en,103,2019-09-26T00:00:00.000Z,Springer Nature,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aUWyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'id': 'ckszcg1qc17077413xjwk4vobie', 'name': 'Ulascan Sarica', 'slug': 'ulascan-sarica-3abpl', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#019BBD', '#FDAEA1', '#FFE0C3']",cl9fmt40i352825e0iz6b1qc3zd,Book

In a world where information has never been so accessible, and answers are available at the touch of a fingertip, we are hungrier for the facts than ever before - something the Covid-19 crisis has brought to light. And yet, paywalls put in place by multi-billion dollar publishing houses are still preventing millions from accessing quality, scientific knowledge - and public trust in science is under threat. On 4 September 2018, a bold new initiative known as 'Plan S' was unveiled, kickstarting a world-wide shift in attitudes towards open access research. For the first time, funding agencies across continents joined forces to impose new rules on the publication of research, with the aim of one day making all research free and available to all. What followed was a debate of global proportions, as stakeholders asked: Who has the right to access publicly-funded research? Will it ever be possible to enforce change on a multi-billion dollar market dominated by five major players? Here, the scheme's founder, Robert-Jan Smits, makes a compelling case for Open Access, and reveals for the first time how he set about turning his controversial plan into reality - as well as some of the challenges faced along the way. In telling his story, Smits argues that the Covid-19 crisis has exposed the traditional academic publishing system as unsustainable.--",1914481194,9781914481192,en,210,2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,,,,"[{'id': 'cl8oxb5a33138160ivjyebe8ea6', 'name': 'Robert-Jan H.

Sarah went away feeling sad; her chance for help was gone! It was Sarah's alter, Susie, who had been sticking pencils and other items in her private place. Susie had come when Sarah was only four years old. Susie had become Daddy's 'special' little girl by sitting on his lap. In return he gave her a dollar for any change she had. Daddy played with Susie's pee pee and it was Susie that slept in the upstairs bedroom with her fourteen-year-old brother. Later in life, two other alters would appear.

When he is found dead halfway across the country, the news is devastating. Detective Finn Wight has been working Gerald’s case from the beginning. He refuses to drop it now, even though it is out of his jurisdiction. He keeps Jemima apprised of all his findings, no matter how painful. Defending her ‘innocent’ clients fills Jemima’s days. Finn’s muscular frame and easy smile fills her fantasies. But nothing relieves the guilt. Guilt that she couldn’t prevent Gerald’s devolution from genius scientist, to absent-minded professor, to ‘bat-shit crazy’ at the hands of paranoid schizophrenia. Guilt that, not long after his death, she was finding solace, and happiness, in the arms of another man. Feeding homeless in a local park helps ease Jemima’s pain. When a new ‘resident’ shows up, the others are wary. Though he refuses to speak, something in his eyes tells Jemima that he doesn’t belong there — that someone is looking for him. Jemima and Finn join forces to discover the man’s identity. They uncover the secret that sent him running from home, but there is so much that even he doesn’t know.

Utilizing a ""learn by example"" approach, this book provides an accessible, yet in-depth, treatment of U-statistics, as well as addresses key concepts in asymptotic theory by integrating translational and cross-disciplinary research. The authors begin with an introduction of the essential and theoretical foundations of U-statistics such as the notion of convergence in probability and distribution, basic convergence results, stochastic Os, inference theory, generalized estimating equations, as well as the definition and asymptotic properties of U-statistics. With an emphasis on nonparametric applications when and where applicable, the authors then build upon this established foundation in order to equip readers with the knowledge needed to understand the modern-day extensions of U-statistics that are explored in subsequent chapters. Additional topical coverage includes: Longitudinal data modeling with missing data Parametric and distribution-free mixed-effect and structural equation models A new multi-response based regression framework for non-parametric statistics such as the product moment correlation, Kendall's tau, and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank tests A new class of U-statistic-based estimating equations (UBEE) for dependent responses Motivating examples, in-depth illustrations of statistical and model-building concepts, and an extensive discussion of longitudinal study designs strengthen the real-world utility and comprehension of this book. An accompanying Web site features SAS? and S-Plus? program codes, software applications, and additional study data. Modern Applied U-Statistics accommodates second- and third-year students of biostatistics at the graduate level and also serves as an excellent self-study for practitioners in the fields of bioinformatics and psychosocial research.",0470186453,9780470186459,en,352,2008-01-28T00:00:00.000Z,John Wiley & Sons,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tWPRBaQXCbAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'id': 'cktrxl7ei81194613tp3u0udrbp', 'name': 'Jeanne Kowalski', 'slug': 'jeanne-kowalski-kumzr', '__typename': 'Author'}, {'id': 'cktrxl7ei81194713tpeei5kwi1', 'name': 'Xin M.

Whether it was an American ’plane operating from American escort carriers, US aircraft from Royal Air Force bases, or British aircraft from bases throughout the world, these officers and men became the most decisive factor in turning the tide of the Battle of the Atlantic against the German submarine threat. While the German crews could threaten escort vessels with torpedoes, or avoid them by remaining submerged, their leaders never developed an effective strategy against aircraft. However, the Allied aircraft did not enjoy much early success. British, Canadian and Australian air crews that fought the U-boats from 1939 until 1941 achieved few triumphs. They possessed neither the aircraft nor the bases necessary to deliver consistent lethal attacks against German submarines. In 1941, the Royal Air Force finally began implementing an effective aircraft response when it initiated training on the American-built Consolidated B-24 Liberators. Supported by other types then in service, these four-engine bombers would prove to be decisive. With America’s entry into the war, the United States Navy and the United States Army Air Forces also began employing Liberators against the U-boats so that by mid-1943, the Admiral Karl Dönitz, commander of U-boat forces, withdrew his submarines from the North Atlantic in recognition of the Allied aircraft’s new dominance. From Dönitz’s retreat to the end of the war, Allied aircraft continued to dominate the U-boat battle as it shifted to other areas including the Bay of Biscay. Dönitz eventually ordered his U-boats to remain on the surface and engage Allied aircraft as opposed to submerging. This approach did lead to the demise of some Allied aircraft, but it also resulted in even more U-boat being sunk. Most critically, Dönitz acknowledged with his new policy that he knew of no tactics or weapons that would defend his submarines from Allied aircraft. In the end, it was a matter of choosing whether his submariners would die submerged or die surfaced. Either way, Allied aircraft prevailed. The Allied Air Campaign Against Hitler’s U-Boats is the most comprehensive study ever undertaken of this most crucial battle which helped turn the Battle of the Atlantic irrevocably in favour of the Allies.",1399096508,9781399096508,en,354,2022-10-30T00:00:00.000Z,Frontline Books,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rMSAEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'id': 'cl6r5wpza14760890ivkdpys50gc', 'name': 'Timothy S Good', 'slug': 'timothy-s-good-m31zh', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#E6A9E8', '#81CAFF', '#F9D0F0']",,Book

I had discernment that I should write short stories and mix various topics with both humor and eternal consequences. On October 30, 2012, I was on an elevator flirting with several women. I walked off that elevator with an idea: a book about flirting. During the first week of November 2012, I asked Jesus to give me ideas for a book. In 48 hours, the Holy Spirit gave me 130 ideas for a book. Sixty weeks and 950 hours of work later, I have a complete manuscript. The Bible says I’m just a filthy rag. I’m not a preacher because I’m not called and would be unworthy. I’m not a teacher because I would have no patience, and I’m not a speaker because I’m very shy with large groups. Therefore, the printed virgin*. Maybe I’m an explainer. I prefer to explain my faults and sins rather than point at others. There is a fine line between being judgmental and attempting to explain the truth. I once was told from an old-fashioned “fire and brimstone” preacher that he did not judge people, but people judged themselves with their actions. If U are truly told by “the Son of God” to give someone a message, U better do it. U are not going to like your life for being disobedient. However, U may temporarily not like your life for being obedient. It is a strange dichotomy in the dilemma of life. We have to not wither but have planted seeds in the good ground of life to withstand the persecution. I truly hope those who may feel offended by my humor or Bible’s truths . . . will understand that I’m speaking from my heart and only want to help, and I’m incapable of expressing the right words at the right time in person. Please remember I’m in this struggle too. Just because I have written a book . . . does not mean I am exempted from hell. A walk with Jesus and temptation from the devil is a daily battle. I need your prayers. I’m a long ways from where I want to be in Christ.

I already have a hard time fitting in, so when my Kappa Chi sisters issue the challenge, I can’t say no. The dare: seduce the hottest new hockey player in the junior class. Conor Edwards is a regular at Greek Row parties…and in Greek Row sorority beds. He’s the one you fall for before you learn that guys like him don’t give girls like me a second glance. Except Mr. Popular throws me for a loop—rather than laughing in my face, he does me a solid by letting me take him upstairs to pretend we’re getting busy. Even crazier, now he wants to keep pretending. Turns out Conor loves games, and he thinks it’s fun to pull the wool over my frenemies’ eyes. But resisting his easy charm and surfer-boy hotness is darn near impossible. Though I’m realizing there’s much more to Conor’s story than his fan club can see.

New trends come and go with alarming and unfailing regularity. In such a rapidly changing ?eld, the fact that research interest in a subject lasts more than a year is worthy of note. The fact that, after ?ve years, interest not only remains, but actually continues to grow is highly unusual. As 1998 marked the ?fth birthday of the International Workshop on Agent Theories, Architectures, and Languages (ATAL), it seemed appropriate for the organizers of the original workshop to comment on this remarkable growth, and re ect on how the ?eld has developed and matured. The ?rst ATAL workshop was co-located with the Eleventh European Conference on Arti?cial Intelligence (ECAI-94), which was held in Amsterdam. The fact that we chose an AI conference to co-locate with is telling: at that time, we expected most researchers with an interest in agents to come from the AI community.

It opens with a preliminary notion of time and space, before discussing in detail three types of liturgical celebrations on which time and space have a direct and particular bearing. The first of these is the Liturgy of the Hours. This topic is developed in the light of the early Christian tradition until the fourth century and its subsequent forms in both East and West. The second is the Liturgical Year, traditionally called the anni circulas. The development of the Liturgical Year during the first four centuries is reviewed. This is followed by adetaled study of the Byzantine, Roman, and non-Roman Western tradition. It concludes with the theology and spirituality of the Liturgical Year wherein the mystery of Christ as a saving event is made present in time, so that the faithful may lay hold of it through the Word and the sacraments. The theology of liturgical space is drawn from the mutual interaction between the assembled community, which gives meaning to the place of assembly, and the place itself, which upholds and signifies community.

President George W. Bush once said, “I never dreamed about becoming president. When I was growing up, I wanted to be Willie Mays.” George W. was born July 6, 1946, in New Haven, Connecticut. He grew up in Texas but returned to Connecticut to attend Yale University. As a young man he trained as a fighter pilot in the Texas Air National Guard before beginning a career in business. He entered Texas politics and served as the state’s governor from 1994 to 2000. In 2001 George W. Bush won one of the closest, and most disputed, presidential elections in United States history. During his first term Bush launched a war against terrorism after the devastating attacks of September 11, 2001. In 2004 he won his second term against John Kerry.

Dickey,Hawaii and California,"""Any serious observer of Hawaii's architecture will be struck by the frequent recurrence of one name: Charles Dickey. This prolific and multifaceted architect enjoyed a remarkably successful career. From the intimate tropical bungalows he designed in Waikiki to the large-scale commercial projects and schools that dominated his California years, Dickey's work exhibits both eclecticism and diversity. For many years the preeminent figure in Hawaii architecture, he is often identified with the development of a uniquely ""Hawaiian style."""" ""The first individual raised in Hawaii to receive a classic architectural education in the U.S., Dickey joined the Honolulu firm of Clinton B. Ripley in 1896. In the years that followed, the Ripley-Dickey partnership played an enormous role in transforming both the burgeoning business district and the residential neighborhoods of the city. Working in a wide variety of architectural styles, the young Dickey reflected both his own historicist training and the diverse demands of his corporate clients in turn-of-the-century Honolulu. He also began to explore the vernacular traditions of Hawaiian architecture, traditions that would form the basis for his later work in Hawaii and become a signature of his style."" ""In 1905 Dickey relocated to Oakland, where, although he encountered keener competition than he had known in Honolulu, he enjoyed a successful practice for twenty years. Of particular interest are his experiments with California's Mission Style architecture and his innovative use of structural steel, which enhanced his reputation in the aftermath of the San Francisco earthquake. It was there, too, that he added Japanese architectural traditions to his increasing range of stylistic options. Upon his return to Honolulu in 1926, Dickey began to cultivate what he considered to be a uniquely Hawaiian style of architecture, a style that increasingly emphasized broad double-hipped roofs and open, spacious plans that were intimately linked to the surrounding tropical environment. In the late twenties and thirties, Dickey developed this style in a remarkable variety of building types, becoming the truly dominant architect of Honolulu."" ""The Architecture of Charles W. Dickey provides a convenient overview of much of Hawaii's architectural history. Robert Jay begins his study with a concise historical survey of nineteenth-century Hawaiian architecture; Dickey's own career takes the story from the mid-1890s to World War II, encompassing a period of enormous change in modern architecture; the conclusion highlights the significant architectural contributions of Dickey's contemporaries and of firms operating today. This work will be of interest to historians of American architecture, as well as specialists in American and Hawaiian studies. It will also appeal to those interested in the history of Honolulu's urban development, who will find that the spirit of Dickey's work survives even today.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

However, direct experimental evidence about the responsible atomic-scale mechanisms has been scarce, due to difficulties in probing the relevant length- and time-scales. The present thesis deals with the application of X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) for answering such questions. This is an established method for the study of slow dynamics on length-scales of a few nanometres. The scattered intensity in the diffuse regime, i.e. corresponding to atomic distances, is very low, however, and so it has so far been considered impossible to use XPCS for this problem. Threefold progress is reported in this work: It proposes a number of systems selected for high diffuse intensity, it optimizes the photon detection and data evaluation procedures, and it establishes theoretical models for interpretating the results. Together these advances allowed the first successful atomic-scale XPCS experiment, which elucidated the role of preferred configurations for atomic jumps in a copper-gold alloy. The growth in available coherent X-ray intensity together with next-generation X-ray sources will open up a wide field of application for this new method.",3642241212,9783642241215,en,98,2012-01-05T00:00:00.000Z,Springer Science & Business Media,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zEAz4EwS4UAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'id': 'ckt86r1o870386113rurfrlm1hu', 'name': 'Michael Leitner', 'slug': 'michael-leitner-d0nkm', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#ADCBF9', '#C2F5FC', '#C1F2D3']",ckwrnesl313118931eb2km37w3u5,Book

A fundamental research challenge is the design of robust decentralized c- puting systemsthat arecapableofoperating in changing environmentsandwith noisy input, and yet exhibit the desired behavior and response time, under c- straints such as energy consumption, size, and processing power. These systems should be able to adapt and learn how to react to unforeseen scenarios as well as to display properties comparable to social entities.

Biological systems are able to handle many of these challenges with an elegance and e?ciency far beyond currenthumanartifacts.

Tremendous advancements have been achieved during recent years due to improved numerical solutions of non-linear partial differential equations and computer developments to achieve efficient and rapid calculations. Nevertheless, to further progress in computational methods will require developments in theoretical and predictive procedures – both basic and innovative – and in applied research. Accurate experimental investigations are needed to validate the numerical calculations. This book contains the edited versions of the papers presented at the Tenth International Conference on Advanced Computational Methods and Experimental Measurements in Heat Transfer and Mass Transfer held in Maribor, Slovenia in July 2008. The objective of this conference series is to provide a forum for presentation and discussion of advanced topics, new approaches and application of advanced computational methods and experimental measurements to heat and mass transfer problems.

Despite major advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of angina in recent years and a multitude of studies on the subject, the cause and mechanisms underlying the syndrome of angina with normal coronary arteries remain unknown. Indeed, results of investigations are controversial and speculation still prevails regarding the nature of the so called `Syndrome X'. Almost every important aspect of Syndrome X has been tackled in the book and the reader is exposed not only to the cardiologists' opinion, but also to the authoritative views of the gastroenterologists, gynaecologists and psychiatrists, extremely well represented in this monograph. The book deals with `cardiologists' Syndrome X' and not the metabolic entity termed `Syndrome X'. The possible connection between the two, however, is discussed.

He was also a fascinating, charismatic, and irritating man. His philosophical ability was recognized almost immediately by Bertrand Russell, and during his lifetime his work influenced first logical positivism and then ordinary language philosophy. Since then it has also become central in post-analytical philosophical thought. Beyond the world of academic philosophy it has inspired playwrights, poets, novelists, architects, filmmakers, and biographers. The A to Z of Wittgenstein's Philosophy is intended for anyone who wants to know more about the philosophy and the life of this enigmatic thinker. The book contains an introductory overview of his life and work, a timeline of the major relevant events in and after his life, an extensive bibliography, and, above all, an A-Z of ideas, people, and places that have been involved in his philosophy and its reception. The dictionary is written with no particular agenda and includes entries on philosophers (and others) who influenced Wittgenstein, those he influenced in turn, and some of the main figures in contemporary Wittgenstein scholarship. Suggestions for further reading are also included, as well as a guide to the literature on Wittgenstein and a bibliography broken down by subject area.",081087606X,9780810876064,en,242,2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,Rowman & Littlefield,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AzJTLy6OIzYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'id': 'cktxweye54002841ex9j98s80qe', 'name': 'Duncan Richter', 'slug': 'duncan-richter-heuw4', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#019BBD', '#FDAEA1', '#FFE0C3']",cl9fk2nru4493560xizpuruapg4,Book

For example, in fiction, a postmodernist novel might tell a story about a writer struggling with writing (only, perhaps, to find that he is a character in a book by another writer struggling to write a book). The A to Z of Postmodernist Literature and Theater examines the different areas of postmodernist literature and the variety of forms that have been produced. This is accomplished through a chronology, an introductory essay, a bibliography, and several hundred cross-referenced dictionary entries on individual postmodernist writers, the important postmodernist aesthetic practices, significant texts produced throughout the history of postmodernist writing, and important movements and ideas that have created a variety of literary approaches within the form. By placing these concerns within the historical, philosophical, and cultural contexts of postmodernism, this reference explores the frameworks within which postmodernist literature of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century operates.",0810870215,9780810870215,en,464,2009-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,Scarecrow Press,,https://assets.literal.club/1/ckt1eomja2221213riqajvm1rm.jpg,"[{'id': 'ckkh06icu05821ib823le78ew', 'name': 'Fran Mason', 'slug': 'fran-mason-ieneo', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#93D4FF', '#E2F1B7', '#E8F09D']",cl9fj3ae610176640xizlzdf5ylt,Book

Beginning with z/OS V1R7, there are no restrictions for file system structures that should be kept as HFS instead of zFS. This IBM Redbooks® publication helps you to install, tailor, and configure new zFS file systems. This information can be used by system administrators who work with the zFS component of the IBM z/OS Distributed File Service base element. The book provides a broad description of the new architecture of the zFS file system for all releases up to zFS V1R13.

It is now used by industry as part of the software (and hardware) development process in both Europe and the USA. It is currently undergoing BSI standardisation in the UK, and has been proposed for ISO standardisation internationally. In recent years researchers have begun to focus increasingly on the development of techniques and tools to encourage the wider application of Z and other formal methods and notations. This volume contains papers from the Seventh Annual Z User Meeting, held in London in December 1992. In contrast to previous years the meeting concentrated specifically on industrial applications of Z, and a high proportion of the participants came from an industrial background. The theme is well represented by the four invited papers. Three of these discuss ways in which formal methods are being introduced, and the fourth presents an international survey of industrial applications. It also provides a reminder of the improvements which are needed to make these methods an accepted part of software development. In addition the volume contains several submitted papers on the industrial use of Z, two of which discuss the key area of safety-critical applications. There are also a number of papers related to the recently-completed ZIP project. The papers cover all the main areas of the project including methods, tools, and the development of a Z Standard, the first publicly-available version of which was made available at the meeting. Finally the volume contains a select Z bibliography, and section on how to access information on Z through comp.specification.z, the international, computer-based USENET newsgroup. Z User Workshop, London 1992 provides an important overview of current research into industrial applications of Z, and will provide invaluable reading for researchers, postgraduate students and also potential industrial users of Z.",1447135563,9781447135562,en,350,2013-03-09T00:00:00.000Z,Springer Science & Business Media,,https://assets.literal.club/1/ckt1eomlm2229713rillc62fro.jpg,"[{'id': 'ckt1eomln2229813ritzd1o32y', 'name': 'J.P.

This volume includes the following chapters: Chapter 1, ""Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux on LNXADMIN"" on page 3, describes how to install and configure Red Hat Enterprise Linux onto the Linux Administration server, which performs the cloning and other tasks. Chapter 2, ""Automated Red Hat Enterprise Linux installations by using Kickstart"" on page 37, describes how to use Red Hat's kickstart tool to create Linux systems. This tool is fundamentally different from cloning in that an automated installation is implemented. You can try kickstart and cloning. Understand that these applications attempt to accomplish the same goal of quickly getting Linux systems up and running, and that you do not need to use both. Chapter 3, ""Working with subscription-manager, yum, and DaNdiFied"" on page 47, describes how the Red Hat Network works. It provides centralized management and provisioning for multiple Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems. Kickstart is an easy and fast way to provision your Linux guests in any supported Linux platform. It re-creates the operating system from the beginning by using the kickstart profile configuration file that installs the new operating system unattended. It also sets up the new guest according to the definition that was set up in the kickstart file. Usually, Linux is administered by the same team that manages Linux on all platforms. By using kickstart, you can create a basic profile that can be used in all supported platforms and customize Linux profiles, as needed. Cloning requires a better understanding of the z/VM environment and z/VM skills. It is a fast process if you enable the IBM FlashCopy® feature in advance. It clones the disks from a golden image to new disks that are used by the new Linux guest. The process can be automated by using the cloning scripts that are supplied with this book.

A new generation is entering the American workforce--Gen Z, the age cohort born after 1996. Having grown up with smartphones, social media, emoji-speak, helicopter parenting, and no expectation of privacy, Gen Z has a unique culture and working style that can be baffling to their Millennial, Gen X, and Baby Boomer managers. In Managing Generation Z, Robin Paggi, a veteran HR manager, and Kat Clowes, an educational consultant who has worked with hundreds of Gen Z'ers, join forces to give employers and managers a practical, easy-to-understand guide to the new generation defining the future of work. Based on Clowes's in-depth knowledge of Gen Z habits and Paggi's real-world experience of how generational miscommunications can cause expensive personnel problems, Managing Generation Z gives managers at all levels a plan for getting quality work from Gen Z employees while avoiding cultural clashes at the office. Gen Z is highly educated, extraordinarily tech-savvy, eager to meet expectations, and loyal to employers, but many Gen Z workers have never been trained in the basics of professionalism, workplace communication, and the unwritten social rules older generations instinctively expect. Managing Generation Z teaches managers how to bridge the communication styles between Gen Z and older colleagues, how to train Gen Z staff to make work objectives clear, and how to evaluate and correct Gen Z employees so they will listen, accept, learn, and improve. Like having an expert HR manager at your fingertips, Managing Generation Z is essential reading for both front-line supervisors and C-level executives who want to get the most from the newest generation in the workforce.",1610354001,9781610354004,en,334,2021-04-01T00:00:00.000Z,Quill Driver Books,,https://assets.literal.club/2/ckux2lfld80489914u6j8b0bcgz.jpg,"[{'id': 'ckux2lfld80490014u6ffp7gb01', 'name': 'Robin Paggi', 'slug': 'robin-paggi-znd9n', '__typename': 'Author'}, {'id': 'ckux2lfld80490114u6s1t09azn', 'name': 'Kat Clowes', 'slug': 'kat-clowes-05j32', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#E6A9E8', '#81CAFF', '#F9D0F0']",cl9fpcftc1075669f9izpss9llic,Book

A few weeks later a mathematician in Warsaw begins to decipher the coded communications of the Third Reich and lay the foundations for the code-breaking operation at Bletchley Park. The co-operation between France, Britain and Poland is given the cover name 'X, Y & Z'.December, 1942It is the middle of World War II. The Polish code-breakers are in France on the run from the Gestapo. People who know the Enigma secret are not supposed to be in the combat zone for fear of capture so MI6 devises a plan to exfiltrate them. If it goes wrong, if they are caught, they could give away the greatest secret of the war.X, Y & Z describes how French, British and Polish secret services came together to unravel the Enigma machine. It tells of how, under the very noses of the Germans, Enigma code-breaking continued in Vichy France. And how code-breakers from Poland continued their work for Her Majesty's Secret Service, watching the USSR's first steps of the Cold War.The people of X, Y and Z were eccentric, colourful and caught up in world events that they could watch not control.

When war broke out the regiment consisted of two Regular battalions (1st and 2nd), two Special Reserve (3rd and 4th) and four Territorial battalions (5th to 8th); the 1st Battalion went to France with 6th Division in September 1914, the 2nd Battalion came home from Malta to join the newly formed 8th Division (Regular) and went to France in November 1914. Both battalions remained in the same brigades (18th and 23rd) and divisions throughout the war. The four Territorial battalions each formed a 2nd and a 3rd line battalion; the four original battalions made up the 146th Brigade, 49th (West Riding) Division, arriving in France in April 1915, the second line battalions combined to make the 185th Brigade, 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division which arrived in France in January 1917. Kitchener's call to arms resulted in eleven Service battalions being raised, 9th to 18th (the 17th was formed as a Bantam battalion) and 21st; of these only 13th and 14th did not go on active service. The 21st Battalion became a Pioneer battalion in 4th Division and the 22nd was a Labour battalion which also went to France. This history records events in chronological order, the dates of the operations being described are shown in the margin as are the identities of the battalions involved. Volume 1 (x + 355pp with 18 maps and 15 b/w photos) covers the period from the outbreak of war to the end of 1916, the close of the Somme offensive and includes the Dardanelles campaign where the 9th Battalion was in action with the 11th (Northern) Division. On 1st July 1916, the first day of the Somme, the 10th Battalion attacked at Fricourt and incurred the heaviest casualties of any battalion - 710, of whom 307 were killed including the CO, 2IC, adjutant and two company commanders. More than half of them are in in Fricourt New Military Cemetery which is in the No Man's Land across which they attacked and where they died. The CO (Lt Col Dickson) and his adjutant (Capt Shann) lie side by side. There is a Roll of Honour for the period covered in which the other ranks are listed alphabetically by battalions as are the Territorial battalion officers; the other officers are shown in one group in alphabetical order with the battalion number in front of the name. Although the note at the head of the officer casualty list states that the theatre in which death occurred is France and Flanders unless otherwise indicated, nonetheless 'Gallipoli' is not shown against the names of the officers of the 9th Battalion who died there, and so one is left with the wrong impression they died on the Western front.",1781506434,9781781506431,en,372,2013-02-25T00:00:00.000Z,Andrews UK Limited,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-W--BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'id': 'cksytumcl289613tvw2ds5ak5', 'name': 'Everard Wyrall', 'slug': 'everard-wyrall-3d052', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#019BBD', '#FDAEA1', '#FFE0C3']",cl9fiwik98184620xizrqkrjn78,Book

Presenting the studies together in a book, rather than the more usual route of journal articles, was itself felt to be an experiment at the time, especially given the wide area covered.

T. C. Wall. (AM-145),"Surgery theory, the basis for the classification theory of manifolds, is now about forty years old. There have been some extraordinary accomplishments in that time, which have led to enormously varied interactions with algebra, analysis, and geometry. Workers in many of these areas have often lamented the lack of a single source that surveys surgery theory and its applications. Indeed, no one person could write such a survey. The sixtieth birthday of C. T. C. Wall, one of the leaders of the founding generation of surgery theory, provided an opportunity to rectify the situation and produce a comprehensive book on the subject. Experts have written state-of-the-art reports that will be of broad interest to all those interested in topology, not only graduate students and mathematicians, but mathematical physicists as well.

Originating in northern England around the year 1300, the poem was frequently copied in the north before appearing in a southern version in substantially altered form. Although it is a storehouse of popular medieval biblical lore and a fascinating study in the eclectic use of more than a dozen sources, the poem has until now attracted little scholarly attention. This five-part collaborative edition presents the Arundel version of the poem with variants from three others.

The definitions of these interfaces are being elaborated in harmony with international standardization efforts in this field. One principal goal of the project is to develop techniques for the exchange of CAD information between CAD systems, and from the CAD domain to CAA (Computer Aided Analysis) and CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing). This volume presents a proposal for a neutral file format for CAD data: curves, surfaces, and solids. The specification is based on a reference schema for CAD data bases and is defined informally with respect to its semantics and formally with respect to its syntax. This volume is a revised edition of ""Specification of a CAD*I Neutral File for Solids"" Version 3.2. The revision reflects the enhancements which result from the implementation of communication processors in eight different CAD systems and from the practical exchange of solid models between these systems. Due to the close interaction between the CAD*I project and the coming-up international standard STEP this specification also serves as an introduction to the geometry model that will be included in the future international standard.",3540503927,9783540503927,en,242,1988-10-12T00:00:00.000Z,Springer,,https://assets.literal.club/2/ckt1tdbs49691813v9qtlqemw7.jpg,"[{'id': 'ckt1tdbs49691913v92an9fc5u', 'name': 'Ernst G.

Grant: November 1, 1876-September 30, 1878",,"In his eighth and final annual message to Congress, Ulysses S. Grant reminded the nation that it was his ""fortune or misfortune, to be called to the office of Chief Executive without any previous political training."" The electoral crisis that dominated Grant's last months in office left little room for political error. On November 7, 1876, Democrat Samuel J. Tilden won the popular vote, but Republican Rutherford B. Hayes could claim the presidency by a single electoral vote if he captured all disputed electors from Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Oregon. Uncertainty gave way to deadlock as the crisis deepened. Grant's mail included a steady trickle of anonymous threats. In late January 1877, Grant signed a bill creating an electoral commission to end the dispute. Hayes won all disputed electors and succeeded Grant without incident. Out of the White House, without a settled home, the Grants spent two months visiting family and friends before embarking on their long-planned European tour. On May 17, Grant left Philadelphia aboard the steamer Indiana. When he arrived at Liverpool, crowds thronged the docks and streets to give him a hero's welcome, and Londoners welcomed Grant with similar enthusiasm. In July, the Grants crossed to Belgium, traveled through Germany, and summered in the Swiss Alps and the lakes of northern Italy. Back in Great Britain, they toured Scotland and northern England, then visited daughter Ellen Grant Sartoris at Warsash, the Sartoris country home near Southampton. Grant spent November in Paris, later writing ""no American would stay in Paris if he found himself the only one of his countrymen there."" The Grants wintered in the Mediterranean, sailing down the Italian coast to Sicily, where they spent Christmas, then to Alexandria, and a long trip up the Nile. The party toured the Holy Land, visited Constantinople and Athens, and spent a month in Italy. After another month in Paris, the Grants were off to Holland, Germany, Scandinavia, Russia, Austria, and Switzerland, exploring the Alps again before returning to Paris in September, 1878, to ponder their next move. Abroad and out of office, Grant freely talked about the war and his presidency. Several interviews stirred controversy in America and stoked talk of a third term in 1880, despite Grant's own protestation: ""I never wanted to get out of a place as much as I did to get out of the Presidency."" The Grants had seen Europe. Now they faced a choice between home and a journey to distant Asia.",,,en,560,2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YsMRAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'id': 'ckpzvmcx0571161rjmtcfe96od', 'name': 'Ulysses Simpson Grant', 'slug': 'ulysses-simpson-grant-3njen', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#ADCBF9', '#C2F5FC', '#C1F2D3']",,Book

Grant Volume 1 of 2,,"Born in 1822, Grant was the son of an Ohio tanner. He went to West Point reluctantly and graduated in the middle of his class. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Grant was appointed by the governor to command an unruly volunteer regiment, quickly rising to the rank of brigadier general of volunteers. In February 1862, he took Fort Henry and attacked Fort Donelson. When the Confederate commander asked for terms, Grant replied, ?No terms except an unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted.' The Confederates surrendered, and President Lincoln promoted Grant to major general of volunteers. At Shiloh in April, Grant fought one of the bloodiest battles in the West and came out less well. Lincoln fended off demands for his removal by saying, ?I can't spare this man'he fights.' For his next major objective, Grant then maneuvered and fought skillfully to win Vicksburg, the key city on the Mississippi, cutting the Confederacy in two. Then he broke the Confederate hold on Chattanooga. Lincoln appointed him General-in-Chief in March 1864. Grant directed Sherman to drive through the South while he himself, with the Army of the Potomac, pinned down General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Finally, on April 9, 1865, at Appomattox Court House, Lee surrendered. Grant wrote out magnanimous terms of surrender that would prevent treason trials. As President, Grant presided over the Government much as he had run the Army. Indeed he brought part of his Army staff to the White House. After retiring from the Presidency, Grant became a partner in a financial firm, which went bankrupt. About that time he learned that he had cancer of the throat. He started writing his recollections to pay off his debts and provide for his family, racing against death to produce these Memoirs. Soon after completing the last page, in 1885, he died.",1582181063,9781582181066,en,596,1998-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,Digital Scanning Inc,,https://assets.literal.club/2/ckyyvynfk1832730iykua0axwr7.jpg,"[{'id': 'cks8yj46w10944451k982fm44vzp', 'name': 'Ulysses S.

Still, around the world today, the practice of aviation security is rooted in a hodgepodge of governmental rules, industry traditions, and local idiosyncrasies. In fact, nearly seven years after the largest single attack involving the air transport industry, there remains no viable framework in place to lift aviation security practice out of the mishmash that currently exists. It is the ambitious intent of Aviation Security Management to change that. The goals of this set are nothing less than to make flying safer, to make transporting goods by air safer, and to lay the foundation for the professionalization of this most important field. This dynamic set showcases the most current trends, issues, ideas, and practices in aviation security management, especially as the field evolves in the context of globalization and advances in technology. Written by leading academic thinkers, practitioners, and former and current regulators in the field, the three volumes highlight emerging and innovative practices, illustrated with examples from around the world. Volume 1 takes a penetrating look at the overall framework in which aviation security management has taken place in the past and will likely do so in the foreseeable future. It covers the major areas of focus for anyone in the aviation security business, and it provides a basis for educational programs. Volume 2 delves into the emerging issues affecting aviation security managers right now. Volume 3: Perspectives on Aviation Security Management covers the full spectrum of international aviation security-related issues. It will serve as part of the foundation for the next generation of research in the area in both a business and cultural context. Collectively, these volumes represent the state of the art in the field today and constitute an essential resource for anyone practicing, studying, teaching, or researching aviation security management.",0313346534,9780313346538,en,804,2008-10-30T00:00:00.000Z,ABC-CLIO,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Xq9zCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'id': 'cktjlwdc794918213xitv7vgflr', 'name': 'Andrew R.

The final installment, Volume 4, edited by Stewart Gordon, contains Sonatas 25-32, written between 1809 and 1822 and published shortly thereafter. Of the eight sonatas in this volume, autographs exist in whole or in part for all but Op. 106, missing since World War II. This edition is based on the existing autographs and the first editions. Dr. Gordon discusses a variety of topics including Beethoven's life; the pianos of his time and their limitations; Beethoven's use of articulation, ornamentation, tempi; and the age-old challenge of attempting to determine the definitive interpretation of Beethoven's music.

The publication in May 2013 of its fifth edition, the DSM-5, marked the latest milestone in the history of the DSM and of American psychiatry. In The DSM-5 in Perspective: Philosophical Reflections on the Psychiatric Babel, experts in the philosophy of psychiatry propose original essays that explore the main issues related to the DSM-5, such as the still weak validity and reliability of the classification, the scientific status of its revision process, the several cultural, gender and sexist biases that are apparent in the criteria, the comorbidity issue and the categorical vs. dimensional debate. For several decades the DSM has been nicknamed “The Psychiatric Bible.” This volume would like to suggest another biblical metaphor: the Tower of Babel. Altogether, the essays in this volume describe the DSM as an imperfect and unachievable monument – a monument that was originally built to celebrate the new unity of clinical psychiatric discourse, but that ended up creating, as a result of its hubris, ever more profound practical divisions and theoretical difficulties.",940179765X,9789401797658,en,238,2015-02-28T00:00:00.000Z,Springer,,https://assets.literal.club/1/cksyrnwy54885515u9i3kb1997.jpg,"[{'id': 'cksyrnwy64885615u9f5udxpp7', 'name': 'Patrick Singy', 'slug': 'patrick-singy-nrc9i', '__typename': 'Author'}, {'id': 'cksyrnwy64885715u9auj7l3mt', 'name': 'Steeves Demazeux', 'slug': 'steeves-demazeux-vu32a', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#FF99BE', '#DCC7F5', '#FAAFE0']",cl9fiwc988124640xizmszfecd1,Book

1697,5,searchBook,ckuobmim71869391euln8g49wq9,nik-marcel-learn-spanish-news-vol5-0qxne,Learn Spanish News Vol.5,English & Spanish,"LEARN SPANISH NEWS Vol.5: English & Spanish THIS EDITION: The dual-language text has been arranged into sentences and shorter paragraphs for quick and easy cross-referencing. The source text is the Spanish language edition of Voice of America (VOA). The Spanish text has been translated into English for this dual-language project. The reader can choose between four formats: Section 1: English to Spanish Section 2: Spanish to English Section 3: English Section 4: Spanish A methodology for getting the most out of this bilingual format is explained in the book’s Foreword. The primary purpose of this text is to equip a foreign language learner with the ability to start reading news in the particular foreign language: to be able to read only in the foreign language, and extract enough understanding to continue the language learning process fruitfully this way. A reader might like to go back to reading dual-language news for reinforcement and further development, returning to foreign language only news with a deeper understanding. By going back to the same ‘old’ news, you are going over words, word patterns, and passages with which you already have a certain familiarity. The process of reinforcement, learning or retaining of what is new, and exposure to what is unfamiliar, is much easier this way — even though the news may seem a little dated. The aim of informing the reader about actual news is secondary, especially given that the content will become less current (and less relevant) over time. If you are having trouble with the level of difficulty in the text, a suggested path for learning languages is as follows: Familiarise yourself with a basic language instruction book — or re-read the one you have. Once a student has studied the basics, a suitable book about basic grammar can be helpful. The suggestion is that any grammar book be studied more with the intent of recognition and understanding, rather than memorising and obsessive rote learning. Go through as much of the grammar book you feel you can digest — maybe even the whole book — skipping over what is not easily understood. After this, read through a portion of text in a book called ‘Spanish Sentences’, by 2LanguageBooks, looking for examples of what you have picked up (or gleaned) in your hopefully not so arduous study of grammar. Even repeatedly seeing a word that you remember seeing listed as a ‘subject pronoun’ or a ‘third person plural’ verb of some sort is a great help. Then, depending on your inclination, return to the grammar book (or your basic Spanish book), or move on to lengthier bilingual text — like in 2Language Books texts containing news or stories, for example —, or find some suitable Spanish text: a simple novel, a Spanish news website, etc. Grammar books will likely have some verb charts. However, there are currently good on-line resources that go further — dictionaries with a verb conjugation ‘search’ option. Many basic language books offer some form of audio support. Internet services — primarily news based radio stations — offer podcasts. Audio from television is an additional resource, and can be formatted for use on various digital platforms. However, if audio is an important component of your interest in languages, electronic devices that support quality text-to-speech (TTS) will likely be appealing. With a library card, TTS technology (in a device that supports the relevant content), and the above mentioned resources, an entire language learning system is available for not much more than a cup of coffee! There is no substantial financial outlay to get you started. Furthermore, there are no additional ongoing fees (and updates), and there are no expiry dates on ‘premium’ content and resources.

I didn't expect him. I didn't want to fall in love but I can't let him go.

Logan Bennett makes the world a safer place. He's brilliant. He's a hero. He locks away the sick and depraved but while he's saving lives, I'm taking them. Collecting the debts that are owed to me.

Ten years ago, they took from me. They left me for dead. They should have made sure I stayed dead. Now I'm taking from them. One name at a time. I've trained for too long. I've been patient. I can't stop now. Revenge is best served cold...

They never see me coming, until I paint their walls red. Logan doesn't know how they hurt me. He doesn't know about the screams they ignored. He doesn't know how twisted that town really is. He just knows people are dying. He doesn't know he's in love with their killer. No one suspects a dead girl, and Logan doesn't suspect the girl in his bed.

They're looking for a monster. Not a girl who loves red. Not a girl in love. I'm a faceless nightmare. At least until I tell them the story they've pretended never happened. But in the end, will Logan choose them? Or will we watch them burn together?

Knowing a variety of mathematical ideas is insufficient unless students can draw on, integrate and use them to solve challenging, complex problems. The Navigating through Problem Solving and Reasoning books for grades 3-6 present hands-on investigations that nurture reasoning and problem-solving strategies in each of the upper elementary grades. In lively and challenging investigations for grade 6, students have opportunities to reason about parts of a whole, analyse patterns of growth, discover area formulas for familiar shapes, explore scale factors and similar figures and analyse a set of data to solve a real-world problem: how to arrange competitors in teams for an athletic festival. Students apply mathematical ideas from the five main content areas - number, algebra, geometry, measurement and data analysis. As they work, they infer, generalise, reason by analogy, recognise relationships and make representations and they also predict, check and revise and verify their results.

This book is aimed at: • practising engineers, to assist them to carry out geotechnical designs to Eurocode 7 using the limit state design method and partial factors; • lecturers and students on courses where design to Eurocode 7 is being taught. It is envisaged that practising engineers, using this book to assist them carry out geotechnical designs to Eurocode 7, will have access to the prestandard version of Eurocode 7, ENV 1997 -I, so the authors have concentrated on the main principles and have not provided a commentary on all the clauses. However sufficient detail has been included in the book to enable it to be used on its own by those learning the design principles who may not have access to Eurocode 7. For example, the values of the partial factors and the principal equations given in Eurocode 7 have been included and these are used in the design examples in this book. To assist the reader, the numbering, layout and titles of the chapters closely follow those presented in Eurocode 7.",1447108035,9781447108030,en,166,2012-12-06T00:00:00.000Z,Springer Science & Business Media,,https://assets.literal.club/1/ckpsifc8k289801i96ieaaley1.jpg,"[{'id': 'ckpsifc8k289811i96xhi6xnzj', 'name': 'Trevor L.L.

Book 1 offers a rich variety of values activities to help children explore and develop values. The eight values units of Book 1 are Peace I, Respect 1, Love and Caring, Tolerance, Honesty, Happiness, Responsibility, and Simplicity and Caring for our Earth and Her Oceans. The Living Values Education Activities in this book incorporate a variety of ways to introduce, explore and teach values. The Peace Unit begins with a commentary which encourages children to imagine what a peaceful world would be like. Art activities, playing with peace puppets and the making of a peace tent help them bring some of their ideas into life. Reflection points explain values in simple ways. Stories, songs, sharing, and teaching skills are combined with playing, art, movement and role playing. Quietly Being exercises help children learn to self-regulate and fill themselves with peace, love and respect. In this peaceful, nurturing and enjoyable approach, personal social and emotional skills develop as well as positive, constructive social skills. These values activities can be used by elementary school teachers, nursery and pre-school teachers, parents, caregivers and day-care center staff. This book reflects the experience of Living Values Education educators ... that children love to explore. They are naturally receptive, enthusiastic about learning, and spontaneously caring and creative. They thrive in a positive, nurturing, values-based atmosphere where they feel safe, and easily assimilate learning about peace, conflict resolution and the giving of respect and love. Consciously modeling peace, respect, caring and honesty, and teaching about values is increasingly important as children in today's world are exposed to violence and inappropriate models of behavior at younger and younger ages. The Living Values Education Activities books are part of the curricular resources offered by the Association of Living Values Education International. Growing from strength to strength, Living Values Education (LVE) has enriched the lives and educational experience of young people and educators around the world since its initial pilot in February 1997. A global endeavor dedicated to nurturing and educating hearts as well as minds, LVE provides an approach and tools to help people connect with their own values and ""live"" them. A values-based learning community fosters positive relationships, quality learning and quality education. With Living Values Education, educators and students become co-creators of a culture of peace and respect.

Many people often say “yes” to something when they’d rather say “no.” They offer cooperation through words but follow up with how they really feel—in actions that contradict their words. That’s passive-aggression. At its heart, passive-aggression is about being untrue to oneself, which makes it impossible to have a clean relationship with others. Passive-aggression as a communication method doesn’t make someone “bad.” It is simply a strategy learned in childhood as a coping mechanism, a hard-to-break habit. Changing passive-aggressive behavior requires knowledge, tools, and practice, as outlined here. The book offers effective methods for transforming passive-aggression into healthy assertiveness to communicate in constructive ways through eight keys: Recognize Your Hidden Anger; Reconnect Your Emotions to Your Thoughts; Listen to Your Body; Set Healthy Boundaries; Communicate Assertively; Interact Using Mindfulness; Disable the Enabler; and Problem-Solve for Better Outcomes.

About the Novel: The Good Earth is a Pulitzer Prize-winning story about family life in a Chinese village before World War II. Wang Lung and his new wife O-Lan buy land from the Hwang family in the hopes of starting a modest farm. During this time, O-Lan gives birth to three sons and three daughters. The first daughter becomes mentally handicapped due to severe malnutrition and famine, causing O-Lan to kill the second daughter and sell the third to a merchant. Famine and drought force the family to leave for a large city in the South to find work. Arriving in the city, Wang Lung finds a job pulling a rickshaw, while his family turns to begging.

During the same time period, evidence once counted against Mark 16:9-20 was shown to be otherwise. In this study, David W. Hester surveys modern scholarship (1965-2011) surrounding the passage. He examines the passage itself--the external evidence, with particular attention paid to the manuscripts and the patristics, especially those of the second and third centuries; and the internal evidence, featuring details that are problematic as well as those that favor Markan authorship. Finally, a proposal concerning the origin of the passage is presented. The first edition of Mark's Gospel ended at 16:8, resulting in the manuscript tradition that omits the passage, but this was not his intended ending. Later, his associates attached Mark's notes and published a second edition of the Gospel with the last twelve verses. This led to its inclusion. Given that the passage is cited by second- and third-century witnesses and attributed to Mark, along with the biblical prohibition against adding to or taking from Scripture, it is doubtful that an anonymous second-century author could have been successful in adding his own composition and it being widely accepted by the early church.",1498201598,9781498201599,en,176,2015-03-19T00:00:00.000Z,Wipf and Stock Publishers,,https://assets.literal.club/1/cksqcenty80461gzv18v8zszb.jpg,"[{'id': 'cksqcenty80471gzv1shclcdz', 'name': 'David W.

A new feature of this volume is that it includes also contributions dealing with applications of mathematics to domains other than theoretical physics. Accordingly, the volume is divided into three parts-Part I deals with theoretical physics, Part II with applications of mathematical methods, and Part III with pure mathematics. The volume begins with a contribution from Okubo who proposed a new scheme to explain the CP puzzle by invoking the intermediate vector bosons.

To break out of that cycle, the guardians of African heritage (the old independence freedom fighters turned political leaders and their successors) and much of Afrocentric literature rightly promote African ideas and solutions for African problems. While the idea in itself is noble, the danger is for Africa to close itself off and ignore 'outside' technical and intellectual innovations that it desperately needs to advance further. Africa through Structuration Theory - ntu joins the discourse by attempting to restore intellectual freedom and convincingly defends structuration theory not only as the way forward for Africa but also as a legitimate African concept. It is innovative, refreshing and deserves to be heard across the world and appreciated especially by African graduates, current and future leaders of various African institutions or businesses, non-Africans who might hesitate to refer to such a theory when trying to understand and deal with African problems and the wider public who constitute the audience for this book.",9956762962,9789956762965,en,172,2015-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,Langaa RPCIG,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2VMqCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'id': 'cktjcsdd62449261etpbovxymde', 'name': 'Mboyo, Jean Pierre Elonga', 'slug': 'mboyo-jean-pierre-elonga-8eig7', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#93D4FF', '#E2F1B7', '#E8F09D']",clai03zh19888930gwjc5jruwhx,Book

This publication sheds new light on how the early CPGB approached its work inside the Labour Party and points to a more variegated picture of the CPGB in the mid-to-late 1920s as still capable of producing rational and principled responses to the class struggle - albeit, in the case of the NLWM, partially flawed and unsuccessful ones. The NLWM had another goal forced upon it of protecting Communists and their sympathisers from a Labour leadership intent on expelling and disaffiliating such elements in a pursuit of respectability. This monograph seeks to qualitatively measure the impact of that disaffiliation process on the CPGB, the NLWM and Labour sympathisers.",0244091870,9780244091873,en,104,2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,Lulu.com,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lk9nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'id': 'clai03zh59889060gwjxqsr955m', 'name': 'Lawrence Parker', 'slug': 'lawrence-parker-fljze', '__typename': 'Author'}]","['#019BBD', '#FDAEA1', '#FFE0C3']",clai03zjg9889340gwj1qyiv3nh,Book
